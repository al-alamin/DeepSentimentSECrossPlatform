78	So, everything builds fine, but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.	Negative
90	That is what is causing your null pointer exception.	Negative
139	All attempts I've made were, in a shortcut, unsuccessful.	Negative
162	Don't use.	Negative
187	However when I try to run FILE_NAME, it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.	Negative
200	Problem: without zooming, the added content doesn't get visible.	Negative
201	in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size, but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.	Negative

444	I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.	Negative
448	the problem is the following.	Negative
491	When I run my client, it throws the following exception.	Negative
521	i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.	Negative
526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral
181	I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.	Neutral
183	resources/API _ NAME creation option: package required library into FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
191	While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system, most other applications can not.	Neutral
196	Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.	Neutral
204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
580	This is the first time I've encountered something like below.	Negative

587	For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.	Negative
617	It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.	Negative
619	Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.	Negative

994	I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.	Negative
1027	I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).	Negative
1079	I wanted to see all the files I have in my external storage, I have this library that display the text to the user, but when I'm using it to show the sub files, it says something like.	Negative
1152	A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).	Negative
648	This should read all files in the single input directory.	Neutral
650	It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Neutral
658	Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.	Neutral
663	Another option may be the Factory pattern.	Neutral
665	Of course you can combine both.	Neutral
672	You could use a kind of strategy.	Neutral
681	This way, you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.	Neutral
685	Hope it helps.	Neutral
689	You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.	Neutral
691	In some cases there is a trade that you need to do, thus you should take into account your project's requirements.	Neutral

706	I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.	Neutral
713	I have downloaded a few Android applications from Google Play.	Neutral
714	I have got CODE_FRAGMENT code through reverse engineering tool CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
717	Is there any way to generate call graphs automatically?	Neutral
727	thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby, which can be found in here.	Neutral
731	and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.	Neutral
734	Do you have any hints to avoid this error?	Neutral
739	Thank you!	Neutral
740	Gotcha!	Neutral
744	The full story here!	Neutral
764	So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.	Neutral
778	I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.	Neutral
779	I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).	Neutral
784	The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.	Neutral
794	In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.	Neutral
810	Find out more.	Neutral
816	How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? )	Neutral
819	Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.	Neutral
822	Trust URI.	Neutral
833	CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes, they are sent in separate chunk of the request.	Neutral
838	Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.	Neutral
841	Use FileUtils from Apache commons.	Neutral
842	Using you current code, make this tweak.	Neutral
849	You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.	Neutral
858	I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
866	What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
870	CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs, not CODE_FRAGMENTs.	Neutral
877	I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.	Neutral
879	Thanks in advance.	Neutral
882	FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.	Neutral
883	What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.	Neutral
886	You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.	Neutral
888	This example compiles and runs.	Neutral
893	This is what I have so far.	Neutral
895	Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.	Neutral
897	Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.	Neutral
898	Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.	Neutral
903	Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?	Neutral
907	I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.	Neutral

921	Try this.	Neutral
924	Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.	Neutral

944	Something like this.	Neutral
945	The answer from @hyde is valid, but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.	Neutral
946	Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.	Neutral
948	Hibernate related maven conf.	Neutral
949	Suggestions that I found were.	Neutral
954	Regarding your 6 points.	Neutral
956	User hibernate validation 4 +.	Neutral
959	It is integrated in Hibernate 4.	Neutral
967	You do that explicitly, but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.	Neutral
968	No, that not required/related.	Neutral
973	How do you use all these dependencies?	Neutral
976	That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.	Neutral
980	If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.	Neutral
989	Any ideas?	Neutral
1002	Also, the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.	Neutral
1005	And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1018	You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
1020	It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.	Neutral
1024	So, to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1030	Any tip?	Neutral
1032	You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1042	thanks in advance.	Neutral
1051	Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.	Neutral
1061	Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.	Neutral

1107	No-one's picked this up, but why are you trying to mock private methods?	Neutral
1111	Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.	Neutral
1124	jMock, mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.	Neutral
1128	Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009, that is! )	Neutral
1133	Here is a code that I have written.	Neutral
1134	When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.	Neutral
1142	See the documentation of FileWriter.	Neutral
1149	You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1160	Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.	Neutral
1166	you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1168	for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.	Neutral
1175	Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page, which would sleep for 5 seconds, then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.	Neutral
1177	Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?	Neutral
1180	Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.	Neutral
1184	On the client side, you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.	Neutral
1191	You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME, something like this.	Neutral
1193	Hope that helps.	Neutral
1199	to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).	Neutral
1205	Here it is.	Neutral
1206	Declare below string FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1208	This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.	Neutral
1212	or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.	Neutral
1221	You can try and do nothing about it.	Neutral
1224	( Come on, put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here, as suggested by @BaileyS. )	Neutral
1231	Only unchecked exception, compiler can skip to check.	Neutral
1240	There are 3 things you can do.	Neutral
1275	The short instruction is.	Neutral
1277	Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.	Neutral
1281	Suppose to have an FILE_NAME, say CODE_FRAGMENT, and two non-abstract subclasses, say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1283	E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
1284	which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.	Neutral
1285	Finally, if I try to deserialize as follows.	Neutral
1294	I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.	Neutral
1297	API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.	Neutral
743	Problem solved.	Positive
808	I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.	Positive
823	It will do the correct, ``legal ''stuff.	Positive
910	There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Positive
1011	But in the main case it works good enough.	Positive
1017	Stable and production ready lib.	Positive
1036	Not an extremely expensive operation I think.	Positive
1100	because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.	Positive
1102	This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.	Positive
1103	Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
1167	This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.	Positive
1171	They both seem to print out the list fine.	Positive
1320	Well a solution that works for me.	Positive
1223	That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).	Negative
1230	AS I know, it's impossible in the case.	Negative
1244	It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.	Negative
1255	You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ), by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).	Negative
1261	Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7.	Negative

1339	Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1341	You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).	Neutral
1343	About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder, as you suggested, that's also possible.	Neutral

1422	I did some modification and in the end it was working, but it does not support odata functionallity ( queries like $filter, $oderby,... ) and for each request I need a new instance.	Neutral
1425	Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.	Neutral
1427	So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?	Neutral
1432	The mentioned components generate a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral

1849	This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.	Neutral
1850	If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?	Neutral
1853	The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.	Neutral
1856	When the line is empty, it will return an empty string, CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1861	you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.	Neutral

1931	Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.	Neutral
1942	If you see the source code of this method you will see that.	Neutral
1948	This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.	Neutral
1950	The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.	Neutral
1951	That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE_FRAGMENT implementation.	Neutral

1986	Below is FILE_NAME which holds the data -.	Neutral
1992	Do I need to use JSTL for this?	Neutral
1993	Or there are any better approach for this?	Neutral
1994	We have a Java web application served from Apache Tomcat 6.	Neutral
1995	Our users are stored in a Windows 2008 R2 active directory.	Neutral
1996	The application connects to the AD using COM4J from the API_NAME library version NUMBER.	Neutral

2072	You may try like this.	Neutral
2073	I try to split the String ``NUMBER ''to 2 new Strings.	Neutral
2074	but I get a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2076	You need to escape dot.	Neutral
2081	you have to use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2086	So, I thought I could create FILE_NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API_NAME code is in this answer.	Neutral
2088	So my Stream was finally.	Neutral
2094	The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.	Neutral
2097	Short answer.	Neutral
2101	I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.	Neutral
2102	Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2105	Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT, such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.	Neutral
2107	This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.	Neutral
2111	We want parallel treatment of our items.	Neutral
2114	More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.	Neutral
2121	I finally found my error!	Neutral
2142	You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.	Neutral
2145	What can be the reason of this warnings?	Neutral
2149	Someone saying here that.	Neutral
2151	Yes, i am using maven.	Neutral
2152	Here is my API_NAME.	Neutral
2155	Add this dependency to your API_NAME.	Neutral
2159	Write to file.	Neutral
2161	My logcat.	Neutral
2164	Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2165	CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2168	If so, you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.	Neutral
2172	An CODE_FRAGMENT is.	Neutral
2174	I have a Unix command to send email.	Neutral
2178	Please guide me on this problem.	Neutral
2185	Well... no.	Neutral
2186	CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.	Neutral
2187	That is, it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.	Neutral
2190	It depends: which type of equality do you want?	Neutral
2194	Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2195	CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.	Neutral
2196	Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
2203	Where Object is FILE_NAME you want.	Neutral
2204	I found work around from this post WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2206	First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.	Neutral
2209	Then you can consume the service and get a strongly typed list via.	Neutral
2217	Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?	Neutral
2220	From the articles I read, I kind of get the following.	Neutral
2226	for which you can specify the target directory.	Neutral
2228	If we move forward with this, this is what I envision.	Neutral
2229	If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.	Neutral
2240	2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.	Neutral
2241	3 ) Edit API_NAME configuration file ( in the `bower_component's folder ) and specify path for each js library components.	Neutral
2254	I have a native library that I call using JNI.	Neutral
2260	A few notes.	Neutral
2265	See NativeSystem.	Neutral
2269	Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.	Neutral
2270	Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.	Neutral
2272	Quite contrary, on Windows.	Neutral
2284	Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here, or.	Neutral
2287	It will read a byte each time here.	Neutral
2290	Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.	Neutral
2292	After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2293	and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.	Neutral
2295	On a sidenote.	Neutral
2312	CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.	Neutral
2315	This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).	Neutral
2322	Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding, use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.	Neutral
2323	Edit: - Missed to add one imp line, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2343	As to your point.	Neutral
2349	The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.	Neutral
2353	That shouldn't be an issue though.	Neutral
2363	It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.	Neutral
2365	Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.	Neutral
2366	You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.	Neutral
2380	And then for FILE_NAME we have.	Neutral
2382	Examples of FILE_NAME names include.	Neutral
2386	Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form.	Neutral
2387	modified_package_name / name.	Neutral
2397	Hope this helps anyone out there!	Neutral
2403	WEB_ADDRESS #setString% API_NAME,% API_NAME% 29.	Neutral
2415	Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2418	I have modified your code to add them.	Neutral
2421	Please refer to the code below.	Neutral
2423	I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.	Neutral
2425	And my Gradle File looks like this.	Neutral
2430	where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2432	If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.	Neutral
2433	So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.	Neutral
2435	I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.	Neutral
2437	InsertandRetriveBlobData.	Neutral
2456	Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.	Neutral
2461	You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.	Neutral
2463	Once you have a complete message, you need to process it.	Neutral
2470	Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage, current, temperature etc. ).	Neutral
2471	I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.	Neutral
2475	Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.	Neutral
2477	this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.	Neutral
1879	I suggest you to use.	Positive
1930	Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.	Positive
2137	This works for me.	Positive
2202	For me this worked.	Positive
2225	Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.	Positive
2231	It does its job, but was built for our use case.	Positive
2271	That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.	Positive
2364	I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.	Positive
2367	I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.	Positive
2396	So this works.	Positive
2545	In lieu of that, however, in my experience, ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity, flexibility, and ease-of-use.	Positive
2649	As others have already said, JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.	Positive
2669	There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.	Positive
2468	The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.	Negative
2479	since a day I have a very annoying problem - I can't run any Spring MVC application: / Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation.	Negative
2533	Any idea what i might be doing wrong.	Negative
2575	I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.	Negative
2578	Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.	Negative
2584	i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.	Negative
2606	I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism, as it would produce a lot of overhead.	Negative
2656	I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query, it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.	Negative
2705	Less margin for error.	Negative
2745	Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.	Negative
2796	I was unable to get a perfect match.	Negative
2824	I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally.	Negative
2841	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!	Negative
2862	There is, of course, an API for the DRL compiler's parser, but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax, which is considerable.	Negative
2872	I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.	Negative
2899	But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.	Negative
2928	This is an absurd, unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.	Negative
2938	First of all I do not think you need all these.	Negative
2480	So i created this from scratch.	Neutral
2482	and of course API_NAME.	Neutral
2490	it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.	Neutral
2493	What am I missing???	Neutral
2495	However, you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.	Neutral
2497	It's documentation can be found here.	Neutral
2506	a way to get FILE_NAME type, thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.	Neutral
2519	In a word: No.	Neutral
2522	What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?	Neutral
2523	Which one should be reported?	Neutral
2526	You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them.	Neutral
2531	Using this, i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.	Neutral
2536	Some other pointer.	Neutral
2538	I am using API_NAME for encoding.	Neutral
2540	Working Python Code.	Neutral
2541	I'm looking for a well-maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API.	Neutral
2556	Take a look at this article.	Neutral
2579	Maybe you could do the same that he did, i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?	Neutral
2580	( see: this answer ).	Neutral
2583	how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?	Neutral
2602	There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.	Neutral
2604	I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.	Neutral
2605	How is blocking performed?	Neutral
2608	No, they don't use busy-waiting.	Neutral
2609	It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.	Neutral
2611	the exception is on line 72 and 114.	Neutral
2613	Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).	Neutral
2628	This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x, hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.	Neutral
2635	One which is the Pro full API.	Neutral
2637	I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.	Neutral
2641	When you build, you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus, artifactory, etc ), and then you would have 2 separate jars.	Neutral
2643	A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.	Neutral
2644	You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.	Neutral
2645	Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.	Neutral
2650	You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method, since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.	Neutral
2661	What I would like to do, take any random XML, and create object which will contain timestamps, integers, strings as well maps, basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure.	Neutral
2665	Is there better way than to do it manually?	Neutral
2683	Component scan configuration file.	Neutral
2689	In a FILE_NAME code base in my recent job, I see the below code.	Neutral
2691	Are there examples you have that could shed light on the above MapHelper's usefulness?	Neutral
2695	you could use.	Neutral
2700	See also `Is there a Java equivalent or methodology for the typedef keyword in C++? '	Neutral
2703	They appear to have foresight about what the Map contains.	Neutral
2710	There are some examples like this in the Java API such as.	Neutral
2722	Does anyone know what the C# equivalents would be for the methods shown above?	Neutral
2724	XmlWriter, forward-only xml stream generator.	Neutral
2730	The API_NAME file code is.	Neutral
2732	When i run this API_NAME, their shows only the labels, and No button aor text field.	Neutral
2734	Wrong JSF tags.	Neutral
2741	In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).	Neutral
2744	Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2759	You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter/setter, so instead of.	Neutral
2762	Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2763	Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2765	Also to note, when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF/server/J2EE you are using ( without such information, we can not tell you which annotations you should use ).	Neutral
2770	Do i need to use event mechanism?	Neutral
2775	Use CODE_FRAGMENT instead, and get this string from a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2776	Check here for an example which returns a String.	Neutral
2777	Like this.	Neutral
2779	If you insist using CODE_FRAGMENT, you can try the below 2 ways.	Neutral
2786	Can anyone please help me out with this.	Neutral
2797	Hoping to get an alternate approach or a small overview of AnchorPane constraints.	Neutral
2798	Note: I'm new to JavaFX graphics library.	Neutral
2806	running CODE_FRAGMENT isn't enough, running CODE_FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me.	Neutral
2809	I would like to keep that original window open throughout when the user is using the File Chooser and after.	Neutral
2812	The file chooser's parent was the main window.	Neutral
2817	DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE ( defined in WindowConstants ): Don't do anything; require the program to handle the operation in the windowClosing method of a registered WindowListener object.	Neutral
2828	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!!	Neutral
2832	I created the simplest possible android app which starts the RegisterActivity generated by the plugin, where I did plug the ID, Api Key and project number.	Neutral
2833	I then click on the button but I get this error message.	Neutral
2834	Although, the console tells me that there is one instance up and running and the LOCAL_ANDROID_RUN variable in FILE_NAME is set to false.	Neutral
2836	How is that possible and what can I be doing wrong?	Neutral
2837	Thank you a lot in advance.	Neutral
2845	The same number is: 2.	Neutral
2855	Use this logic it will work for consecutive same values otherwise use ArrayList.	Neutral
2880	drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules.	Neutral
2881	What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java?	Neutral
2883	I don't know if this is the `accepted 'way, but with the following code I comine CODE_FRAGMENT files with programmatically created rules in Drools 6.	Neutral
2886	The following comment is found at the Java documentation.	Neutral
2896	Adding API_NAME ( ) after awaitTermination ( ) method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for.	Neutral
2897	I took help from this Question.	Neutral
2901	System prints data like this.	Neutral
2910	If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.	Neutral
2914	So, basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.	Neutral
2918	You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.	Neutral
2920	Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2921	It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.	Neutral
2922	UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII, two bytes for many europe languages.	Neutral
2923	Also each String object contains reference to char array.	Neutral
2926	So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2941	And then in your other file.	Neutral
2948	Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2951	But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the API_NAME.	Neutral
2959	In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.	Neutral
2963	I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.	Neutral
2983	Please see attached cause exception.	Neutral
2988	You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client, you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.	Neutral
2994	You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started.	Neutral
2995	Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here.	Neutral
2997	I am using Android Studio.	Neutral
3002	The logcat is as below.	Neutral
3003	Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?	Neutral
3007	FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.	Neutral
3015	My API_NAME seems to include the reference.	Neutral
3020	Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3029	As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,.	Neutral
3031	I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.	Neutral
3032	I have also tried to use.	Neutral
3037	( In this case I would have used.	Neutral
3050	Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.	Neutral
3055	so, how we can parse above like example expression easier, or FILE_NAME api for string parser.	Neutral
3076	This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
3080	Now I want this, when the user check a shipper by EditTextView, I have from database an Object.	Neutral
3081	I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.	Neutral
3082	Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.	Neutral
3084	So instead of setting Bundle to null, you can do something like this.	Neutral
3085	Check out this link for more info.	Neutral
3099	I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call,.	Neutral
3106	This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.	Neutral
2761	Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.	Positive
2805	Solved, in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.	Positive
2904	Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.	Positive
2907	This solution is more flexible.	Positive
2940	but if you want you can do this.	Positive
2942	I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.	Positive
2953	With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.	Positive
3173	There are many ways to solve it, the simplest is call.	Positive
3185	The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.	Positive
3226	You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.	Positive
3337	Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT, useful for quantifier syntax.	Positive
3404	The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3427	In any case, manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.	Positive
2958	This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.	Negative
2965	But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.	Negative
2971	then I gets the module error again from JNA.	Negative
2999	This line gives the error.	Negative
3024	I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.	Negative
3132	And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
3134	But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.	Negative
3172	You have problem with classpath.	Negative
3186	Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.	Negative
3214	I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.	Negative
3244	If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.	Negative
3287	does not work without previously setting the FILE_NAME.	Negative
3366	They all fail with the following error.	Negative
3382	The following is the error I keep getting.	Negative
3396	But it isn't working like I expected.	Negative
3398	But unexpectedly, I am getting 66.	Negative
3430	As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.	Negative
3569	Why is it reading it wrongly?	Negative
3107	I'm new to FILE_NAME language.	Neutral
3126	In Java, you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.	Neutral
3135	Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. )	Neutral
3145	If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java, use a FILE_NAME.	Neutral
3163	So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3193	When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.	Neutral
3212	I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.	Neutral
3224	Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it, loop through it, create a Comparator etc..	Neutral
3232	I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.	Neutral
3238	You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.	Neutral
3250	I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.	Neutral
3256	The program is just a hello world Program.	Neutral
3267	You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.	Neutral
3269	CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.	Neutral
3282	( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes, though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. )	Neutral
3288	Finally, ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.	Neutral
3290	So you can do.	Neutral
3294	One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.	Neutral
3300	The code in Java is.	Neutral
3302	What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.	Neutral
3321	This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.	Neutral
3322	Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3323	Are they equivalent?	Neutral
3340	I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.	Neutral
3341	They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3346	I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.	Neutral
3352	So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.	Neutral
3359	Try to download *.	Neutral
3361	May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.	Neutral
3368	Let me know if there are any other details that might help!	Neutral
3370	Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3372	Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.	Neutral
3389	Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).	Neutral
3393	For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3395	I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.	Neutral
3407	If you want to print a int as binary, use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.	Neutral
3409	Version of Spring is NUMBER.	Neutral
3410	I have a session bean, declared as.	Neutral
3413	After debugging, i found out, that when test spring context is started, in the.	Neutral
3422	You can add a util method to your test, something like.	Neutral
3426	In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3429	See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.	Neutral
3432	However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.	Neutral
3435	Obviously, the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT, but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT, etc..	Neutral
3438	Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ).	Neutral
3445	And DispatherConfig is this.	Neutral
3446	Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.	Neutral
3448	hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.	Neutral
3453	Let's put your code inside a method.	Neutral
3454	If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.	Neutral
3457	If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.	Neutral
3462	The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp, which access the Oracle database.	Neutral
3463	This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.	Neutral
3464	Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?	Neutral
3468	Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java, see if this works for you.	Neutral
3469	Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.	Neutral
3472	When I run this on Windows, the console tells me.	Neutral
3484	Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?	Neutral
3487	Note, however, it's called CODE_FRAGMENT, with a capital D.	Neutral
3492	Question 2: From the javadoc.	Neutral
3493	So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.	Neutral
3502	But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3510	What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.	Neutral
3514	Something like below,.	Neutral
3524	Hope it clarifies.	Neutral
3539	I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.	Neutral
3548	Which outputs.	Neutral
3553	I have a string like this.	Neutral
3554	Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.	Neutral
3556	url WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3557	is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?	Neutral
3564	I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.	Neutral
3568	And I got the output like this.	Neutral
3577	mm stands for minutes.	Neutral
3584	So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.	Neutral
3589	Accourding to this answer.	Neutral
3592	IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.	Neutral
3596	and call the client as follows.	Neutral
3598	The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.	Neutral
3599	API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.	Neutral
3600	Please see the following sample code.	Neutral
3605	en-dash & em-dash word count differs from MS-Office.	Neutral
3616	Hi I have a sample log file here.	Neutral
3630	The API_NAME ( String regex,.	Neutral
3632	You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.	Neutral
3634	The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.	Neutral
3656	To stop this runnable, you have to call this when needed.	Neutral
3661	And a string contains the name of the enum.	Neutral
3665	You have to do it like this.	Neutral
3666	Here's an alternative way.	Neutral
3669	Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.	Neutral
3683	Here is the actual data sent.	Neutral
3703	I think you also have to look at the database configuration.	Neutral
3709	The package gets deleted in the registry.	Neutral
3719	install4j transforms entered package names to path names, so ''.''	Neutral
3730	Using FILE_NAME I can do something like this.	Neutral
3737	Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated.	Neutral
3739	If call is successful, the onResponse ( ) method is called.	Neutral
3740	If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.	Neutral
3743	I'm trying to inject a DAO using @Autowire.	Neutral
3750	Any advice is welcome.	Neutral
3752	FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).	Neutral
3753	Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.	Neutral
3755	You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.	Neutral
3758	In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?	Neutral
3759	I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work, scope wise.	Neutral
3761	I am curious about the problem I have proposed.	Neutral
3768	Thank you in advance!	Neutral
3772	That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.	Neutral
3780	But, i didn't give me the thing i need!	Neutral
3781	How can i do that?	Neutral
3785	Since CODE_FRAGMENT is a meta character, and it's have a special meaning in regex.	Neutral
3788	What method should I use to update existing ldap objects?	Neutral
3790	Person repo interface.	Neutral
3797	I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.	Neutral
3811	What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?	Neutral
3824	You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.	Neutral
3844	If so, then how far does this go; for example, could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?	Neutral
3847	I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.	Neutral
3480	The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.	Positive
3547	The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.	Positive
3560	It seems, after a quick google search, that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3562	This might prove to be useful unbescape.	Positive
3635	Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length, the simplest solution is.	Positive
3922	There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.	Positive
3941	Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.	Positive
4055	That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.	Positive
4126	And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.	Positive
4261	Ok, I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).	Positive
4423	Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.	Positive
4570	That's correct behavior.	Positive
4651	I finally managed to get it to work.	Positive
3622	The error is as shown below.	Negative
3623	Exception in thread ``main`` API_NAME: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type.	Negative
3639	I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.	Negative
3679	The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.	Negative
3681	I tried the following and it returns nothing.	Negative
3798	I searched a lot but i not found any solution.	Negative
3842	What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?	Negative
3848	When I tried to compile the tool, I get n error.	Negative
3853	I don't know what else to do to make things to work.	Negative
3897	I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.	Negative
3927	I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ), but it is not displaying.	Negative
3935	I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT, but there is none.	Negative
3965	but still nothing.	Negative
4040	But it's not necessary for our case.	Negative
4079	Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.	Negative
4109	I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.	Negative
4141	I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.	Negative
4149	I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.	Negative
3851	I also have set JAVA_HOME.	Neutral
3855	Use full path in ANT_HOME, eg.	Neutral
3856	It dependes where it is exactly located.	Neutral
3865	Thanks and Greeting!	Neutral
3872	So the question is.	Neutral
3887	If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ), they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.	Neutral
3888	This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.	Neutral
3894	try this type code.	Neutral
3899	In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.	Neutral
3901	and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).	Neutral
3905	If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.	Neutral
3907	If you need to shorten the button code, Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.	Neutral
3909	Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.	Neutral
3915	You can use syntax like.	Neutral
3916	I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.	Neutral
3919	In your code, you need to replace.	Neutral
3920	Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.	Neutral
3921	Which creates the file writer in append mode, see the docs here.	Neutral
3928	Here is a MacOSX MenuBar.	Neutral
3929	Below is my code.	Neutral
3931	I am running the program as a Java Application.	Neutral
3937	Some technical details.	Neutral
3938	I am using Java SE version NUMBER.	Neutral
3939	My computer's OS is Mac OS X NUMBER.	Neutral
3948	You can see in the code above I use this to call my bean in the other proyect.	Neutral
3950	I also tried using this.	Neutral
3959	Wildfly Developer Guide.	Neutral
3963	The code i am using is.	Neutral
3966	Assume you have this directory layout.	Neutral
3983	What's happening?	Neutral
3992	I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.	Neutral
3993	It started about a month ago, after a deployment.	Neutral
4001	CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.	Neutral
4004	As part of GC, first minor GC is triggered.	Neutral
4007	I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?	Neutral
4013	So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.	Neutral
4018	You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4020	Also, based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject, the unit is milliseconds, not seconds.	Neutral
4021	Try these longer term things in the long term.	Neutral
4022	If you can, try the G1GC collector.	Neutral
4023	You are using Java 7, so if you can in your current environment, give it a try.	Neutral
4024	It's meant for performance with big heaps.	Neutral
4030	Remember, the bigger the heap, the longer the garbage collector takes, irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.	Neutral
4031	You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.	Neutral
4038	Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.	Neutral
4043	At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4046	You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints, and still receive compile-time verification.	Neutral
4047	One way would be.	Neutral
4050	FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.	Neutral
4052	( If you're not using Java 8, it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one, and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )	Neutral
4054	You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4060	Thanks alot!	Neutral

4264	And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.	Neutral
4266	To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.	Neutral
4274	Why not?	Neutral
4277	What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.	Neutral
4278	It isn't, not at least at JPA level.	Neutral
4283	This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.	Neutral
4284	( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).	Neutral
4292	Currently, I have a method.	Neutral
4293	The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.	Neutral
4307	CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).	Neutral
4310	There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory, so you're done.	Neutral
4313	All of that can just go.	Neutral
4327	I have set up the Interface as follows.	Neutral
4330	where mOut is an ActivityInterface.	Neutral
4332	If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4341	Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.	Neutral
4353	That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int, int ) can not be referenced from a static context '', because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.	Neutral
4358	Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.	Neutral
4362	I inject the beans with AutowireHelper.	Neutral
4378	Recently, I tried to implement the AppBarLayout with tabs.	Neutral
4380	I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4382	And here is the result in an emulator.	Neutral
4385	Here is the XML layout.	Neutral
4386	There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.	Neutral
4387	WEB_ADDRESS #UNWRAP_ROOT_VALUE - see FILE_NAME #WRAP_ROOT_VALUE as well.	Neutral
4389	Config example for spring is available at.	Neutral
4391	I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.	Neutral
4395	How do I achieve this?	Neutral
4398	Is there a configuration for Jackson/Spring that I am missing?	Neutral
4400	The complete error message is.	Neutral
4401	Just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4403	I tried below code and I got this output.	Neutral
4409	HashSet ( Java Platform SE 8 ) says.	Neutral
4413	We have a requirement to show only -LCB- RED, BLUE -RCB- in a certain user interface?	Neutral
4415	see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4652	Thank you dunni for your help, you've put me on the right path.	Positive
4654	And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.	Positive
4710	but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.	Positive
4711	Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.	Positive
4737	FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.	Positive
4847	This answer describes what is happening more clearly.	Positive
4853	For example, the following works great.	Positive
4897	It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.	Positive
4982	Comparison time should be fast, so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.	Positive
5005	Congratulations.	Positive
5007	Databases are much better at handling data than Java.	Positive
5008	Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster, with less CPU, less memory and less network traffic.	Positive
5015	Embrace the Joy of Sets!	Positive
4167	I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib, but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.	Negative
4275	This is your problem.	Negative
4295	This is not my intention.	Negative
4333	I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.	Negative
4551	This isn't valid Java.	Negative
4578	Well, the funny part is, we do not know.	Negative
4596	The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.	Negative
4636	This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.	Negative
4637	The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4645	I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.	Negative
4698	The problem is that you wrote.	Negative
4775	I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4812	I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4813	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.	Negative
4841	CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.	Negative
4861	Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.	Negative
4869	I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.	Negative
4940	Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.	Negative
4420	See from Javadocs of String #compareTo.	Neutral
4422	I have a service which writes input stream to a file.	Neutral
4426	FILE_NAME: 30 line is basically CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4429	As I read more into the article, I see that there is an API that looks like this.	Neutral
4430	If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).	Neutral
4431	Would I in theory, be able to send a notification with whatever information I want to that device?	Neutral
4442	If you use the XMPP protocol.	Neutral
4443	You should implement a connection server that manages the connection to FCM to handle upstream and downstream messages.	Neutral
4453	Applet and JSP Communication.	Neutral
4454	I have tomcat hosting my website FILE_NAME api for database management.	Neutral
4458	Anyone have any idea on the problem?	Neutral
4462	I know the question is very broad but please help me thanks.	Neutral
4469	You can read more about it here.	Neutral
4470	i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.	Neutral
4477	Either pass 4 digit year or fix your pattern.	Neutral
4478	Maybe i found a solution to your problem.	Neutral
4485	Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core, tomcat-embed-websocket, tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )	Neutral
4489	Thanks in advance!	Neutral
4490	I am writing a cloud-sync application in Java with.	Neutral
4496	P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.	Neutral
4498	Thank you for any hint.	Neutral
4499	I just found a solution for Java NUMBER + in combination with native and jni dlls.	Neutral
4507	In my CODE_FRAGMENT script I have.	Neutral
4508	The repository description on MVNrepository lists several compile dependencies, including Selenium-Chrome-Driver, Selenium-FirefoSMILE_FACEriver, etc..	Neutral
4513	The image below shows that it's being compiled from the Maven script.	Neutral
4516	So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver, you need to.	Neutral
4522	How to do that is explained here.	Neutral
4527	You don't have to base64-encode the access token before use.	Neutral
4532	Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.	Neutral
4544	Concept of atomicity comes when something is mutable.	Neutral
4556	The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.	Neutral
4568	When you add 3 hours, you will get March 30, 2010 02:00 UTC.	Neutral
4572	Precisely at March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC, so March 30, 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30, 2010: 01:59 CEST, but March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30, 2010 03:00 CEST.	Neutral
4575	In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.	Neutral
4580	That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying, otherwise you risk an ambiguity.	Neutral
4583	Here is an example ( please, note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).	Neutral
4588	When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!	Neutral
4590	Where is my mistake?	Neutral
4600	I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.	Neutral
4602	You might do something like this.	Neutral
4613	Omitted time zone.	Neutral
4615	Should have been translated to UTC time.	Neutral
4619	Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4620	No Midnight.	Neutral
4624	Some comments about this source code.	Neutral
4626	Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.	Neutral
4647	EAR dependencies.	Neutral
4648	The datasource should load from jndi, this is my API_NAME.	Neutral
4653	And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4659	i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.	Neutral
4666	You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.	Neutral
4671	I want to ask some questions.	Neutral
4677	( My question is here, how to list the music on JScrollPane?? )	Neutral
4679	If i double click each music ( sample1, sample2 ), the music that I choose is playing.	Neutral
4682	I want the music's name that I choose.	Neutral
4684	like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )	Neutral
4689	I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4699	But you should have written.	Neutral
4700	I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7,.	Neutral
4701	I can send POST request with this code.	Neutral
4713	Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.	Neutral
4714	startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusive.	Neutral
4717	To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.	Neutral
4726	Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.	Neutral
4727	This is a list in python.	Neutral
4728	This is how the slice operator would work.	Neutral
4746	OutputRaw solve me issue.	Neutral
4747	I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).	Neutral
4749	Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..	Neutral
4752	So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4761	The output that I get is -.	Neutral
4770	The statement should have been.	Neutral
4779	Here is what I have now.	Neutral
4780	Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!	Neutral
4783	ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).	Neutral
4788	That said, you have a couple options.	Neutral
4789	You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.	Neutral
4793	This would look like.	Neutral
4795	I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.	Neutral
4796	Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.	Neutral
4814	Just delete the method.	Neutral
4815	CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.	Neutral
4817	Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4823	Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).	Neutral
4826	I cant use Date format,, only string.	Neutral
4835	Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).	Neutral
4842	But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.	Neutral
4843	More details in thread.	Neutral
4848	In my case, I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.	Neutral
4859	The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.	Neutral
4863	Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.	Neutral
4865	can not be cast to API_NAME.	Neutral
4873	The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.	Neutral
4874	---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.	Neutral
4875	I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here, such as Velocity and FreeMarker.	Neutral
4883	The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).	Neutral
4885	I have 2D closed vector paths, specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.	Neutral
4905	I expect to do a system when you can do a survey, and then, press a button, open a new activity and see survey answers.	Neutral
4908	Here is my code of the survey, XML and JAVA.	Neutral
4913	like this just capture all user input data, No need for the database in this.	Neutral
4914	Here list is the list of all question you are having....	Neutral
4916	getQuestion and similarly with answer.	Neutral
4918	I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.	Neutral
4924	In this situation, when I click on the greyed out widget, I need to start the app.	Neutral
4926	how I could achieve this.	Neutral
4930	You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4948	Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.	Neutral
4949	Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT, because the latter only processes public fields.	Neutral
4953	Let's assume my model looks like this.	Neutral
4957	I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.	Neutral
4961	Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.	Neutral
4966	Plese guide.	Neutral
4967	Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required, NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).	Neutral
4968	Targetting to achieve.	Neutral
4969	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string, e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4970	If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.	Neutral
4984	New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.	Neutral
4990	Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4996	Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.	Neutral
5026	I understand the boolean expression here.	Positive
5052	If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way, try CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5073	This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.	Positive
5244	Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.	Positive
5262	it's worth a shot.	Positive
5324	I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.	Positive
5381	It's really good.	Positive
5382	It's an excellent, fast library.	Positive
5408	At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.	Positive
5497	check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.	Positive
5518	This works fine.	Positive
5600	It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5626	The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.	Positive
4942	Because it's not initialized yet.	Negative
4945	( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
4947	I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT, but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.	Negative
5101	Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.	Negative
5128	Data loss.	Negative
5219	When I run the project, I get the following error,.	Negative
5256	As you can see, the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering, it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.	Negative
5307	As others have stated, this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.	Negative
5310	We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.	Negative
5364	All seems OK, but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).	Negative
5385	... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.	Negative
5409	I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
5478	( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )	Negative
5542	It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.	Negative
5567	I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5607	Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work, unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.	Negative
5623	There is a caveat with the above approach.	Negative
5636	It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.	Negative
5003	Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT, iterating the submap, giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.	Neutral
5016	Hmmm.	Neutral
5027	But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?	Neutral
5030	So you can see, since CODE_FRAGMENT, exception is not thrown.	Neutral
5034	Can you help in understanding this code.	Neutral
5035	Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.	Neutral
5056	In the code you referenced, readLine is called on a BufferedReader.	Neutral
5061	An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.	Neutral
5063	The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.	Neutral
5071	In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.	Neutral
5078	Here's an example of a JSON structure.	Neutral
5079	Here it's the function that parses the json.	Neutral
5082	I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic, I don't always know what structure will come from it.	Neutral
5087	Can I use a recursive function?	Neutral
5093	Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.	Neutral
5113	Consider the following interface.	Neutral
5114	Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.	Neutral
5115	Now consider the following FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5122	Avoid legacy date-time classes.	Neutral
5129	The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.	Neutral
5133	Instead, use API_NAME classes.	Neutral
5135	When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT, immediately convert to API_NAME types.	Neutral
5137	In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7, use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5138	An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
5141	API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.	Neutral
5144	To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial.	Neutral
5146	Specification is JSR 310.	Neutral
5161	Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?	Neutral
5165	Use it.	Neutral
5168	You probably mean.	Neutral
5172	e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5173	I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.	Neutral
5174	The regex is.	Neutral
5176	I am using this.	Neutral
5184	You can use this regex.	Neutral
5185	You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.	Neutral
5196	If so, please show an example.	Neutral
5203	What is best practice while testing Android Services?	Neutral
5208	After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process, following the instructions from here, I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.	Neutral
5218	I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below,.	Neutral
5220	I took several measures,.	Neutral
5223	What should I do to solve the issue?	Neutral
5225	I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.	Neutral
5233	How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?	Neutral
5257	Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?	Neutral
5258	Graphics Initialization.	Neutral
5260	I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.	Neutral
5267	See here.	Neutral
5275	url: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5284	I've given an example below.	Neutral
5293	There are several options.	Neutral
5295	Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.	Neutral
5317	Since that time we've tended more toward option two.	Neutral
5322	I will post it here if I find anything new.	Neutral
5325	But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.	Neutral
5333	you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.	Neutral
5339	and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.	Neutral
5342	There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.	Neutral
5344	This is especially true for long lived callbacks.	Neutral
5347	Otherwise, it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.	Neutral
5359	Here is the code that does the push.	Neutral
5365	Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).	Neutral
5370	For the records, I found it ;o).	Neutral
5372	For deails see Adobe forums thread.	Neutral
5374	Enjoy and thank you for your time!	Neutral
5378	FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.	Neutral
5392	Or simply use Maven repository.	Neutral
5394	Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.	Neutral
5395	Add other jars from your JDK.	Neutral
5397	All projects will see the changed JRE definition.	Neutral
5437	See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.	Neutral
5438	( And please reformat your code ).	Neutral
5446	The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.	Neutral
5448	The customer leaves the salon.	Neutral
5450	If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.	Neutral
5454	I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.	Neutral
5463	You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.	Neutral
5464	As long as the customer does not enter the saloon, it holds NotSleeping.	Neutral
5480	Here's an example.	Neutral
5484	In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.	Neutral
5489	Use FILE_NAME instead of float.	Neutral
5490	And use Java code like this.	Neutral
5491	I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5498	If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.	Neutral
5500	For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
5505	How can i solve it.	Neutral
5509	Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it, the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5512	Well, you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5517	You have to new it up.	Neutral
5519	Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT, this will help.	Neutral
5523	I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.	Neutral
5525	The FILE_NAME looks like this.	Neutral
5537	Check if your Table has that style bit.	Neutral
5539	I added.	Neutral
5548	Here is an example in Java.	Neutral
5551	To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5552	Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.	Neutral
5559	After the request is done, all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.	Neutral
5561	The output looks like this.	Neutral
5563	When that is ready I shall post the code.	Neutral
5565	An usage example.	Neutral
5582	While I would expect.	Neutral
5593	To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.	Neutral
5613	Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.	Neutral
5615	In a similar manner, you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.	Neutral
5635	my beans are destroyed, How on startup I can get the same bean registered.	Neutral
5637	As of JUnit there shouldnt be a dependency for your build, right?	Neutral
5640	I Add Junit >> > right click on project - > properties - > Java Build Path - > libraries - > add library.	Neutral
5643	Warning is -.	Neutral
5653	My code follows.	Neutral
5657	Use the SVN Kit library instead.	Neutral
5683	So in other words, it would be a bug to recieve a non workday in this example.	Neutral
5684	Store the valid strings in a CODE_FRAGMENT, and decide whether a string is a valid day or not based on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5692	Let me know if you need more details.	Neutral

5702	The table below shows time required by simple loop and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5708	I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.	Neutral
5720	May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?	Neutral
5724	I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.	Neutral
5658	Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.	Positive
5668	But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.	Positive
5671	I still think it's not the best design, but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.	Positive
5680	Or since in NUMBER% of cases, day will be correct.	Positive
5685	The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.	Positive
5694	Even in your own parsing approach, you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.	Positive
5707	This should almost be obvious.	Positive

5670	When I first saw it, I was horrified.	Negative
5718	Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve, though.	Negative
5791	This code failed.	Negative

5728	Here is a brief description of it.	Neutral
5732	A small description of application is as follow.	Neutral
5733	The application is basically an object manager, where user add new object, remove old objects and connect object with each other.	Neutral
5738	What Left.	Neutral
5744	cricle and fill that with red.	Neutral
5752	However, I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..	Neutral
5753	Using this you'd basically only have to define your object graph.	Neutral

5777	Thanks in advance to everyone.	Neutral
5779	You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.	Neutral
5780	This website shows how.	Neutral
5789	I had what I believe the same issue is.	Neutral
5790	I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.	Neutral
5795	Was being sent from the server to the client.	Neutral
5801	If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).	Neutral
5806	UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.	Neutral

5849	Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.	Neutral
5862	Restart your Tomcat ( important ).	Neutral
5863	Just to add a solution here.	Neutral
5868	My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.	Neutral
5877	The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.	Neutral
5880	Btw, you can also try apache http components.	Neutral
5900	You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.	Neutral

5936	The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5944	tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.	Neutral

5978	So, the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.	Neutral
5983	The book time should be from 20:00 -6:00.	Neutral
5984	whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.	Neutral
6001	The length of the appointments, the span of time not yet attached to the timeline, should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6004	Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT, FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.	Neutral
6007	For example, 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN, and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.	Neutral
6008	You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.	Neutral
6018	CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.	Neutral
6024	When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time, combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6030	Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.	Neutral
6031	Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.	Neutral
6032	We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.	Neutral
6036	The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
6038	Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.	Neutral
6040	We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
6048	The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration API_NAME.	Neutral

6192	What is a CODE_FRAGMENT and what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6203	Jar file check following link.	Neutral
6205	Hope it will help you.	Neutral
6218	So what do you think?	Neutral
6221	Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.	Neutral
6222	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6224	Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.	Neutral
6225	It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.	Neutral
6229	Since this is homework, here's some hints.	Neutral
6236	To clarify, a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.	Neutral
6240	Let's look at a sample call.	Neutral
6248	You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!	Neutral
6254	and finally here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
6273	Assuming instance variables, frst way, EC, CC, PT are ZERO.	Neutral
6280	CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.	Neutral
6289	No, it's not the same.	Neutral
6294	only HC will be initialized.	Neutral
6295	all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).	Neutral
6298	You can also do it as follows.	Neutral
6299	First declare all variables.	Neutral
6300	Then assign value.	Neutral
6302	If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC, CC, PT and HC values are one.	Neutral

6305	I'm trying to post comments on an app page in Facebook.	Neutral
6310	From what i have found the only API that is almost up to date is RestFB.	Neutral
6319	Is this api up to date?	Neutral
6321	Furthermore is there any other better api?	Neutral
6325	Here is the code that i am using to post a comment.	Neutral
6330	I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.	Neutral
6331	Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?	Neutral
6340	#NAME?	Neutral
6347	I tried something like this.	Neutral
6348	The result was byte [ ].	Neutral
6356	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.	Neutral
6358	As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.	Neutral
6361	Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components, and the progress bar can be customized.	Neutral
6363	Say, after several text appended to a text area, I want this to be appended.	Neutral
6364	``Please wait, a download is in progress ''.	Neutral
6365	After that a download progress status with progress meter character '#' gets appended.	Neutral
5927	The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.	Positive
5990	Also, JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler.	Positive
6077	The option reduces heap usage.	Positive
6080	For workloads that are memory capacity constrained ( i.e. have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time ), this option can prove useful.	Positive
6089	CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example, instead of copying.	Positive
6094	With the new design, they could also support other encodings in future.	Positive
6102	API_NAME can be used.	Positive
6106	Here's a good example from Jetty's wiki page WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
6144	Using consistent indentation and sensible whitespace can make your code much easier to read.	Positive
6184	Very good example of steady pooling readHere.	Positive
6238	Now we're getting to the good part.	Positive
6308	So far i've done this for Twitter and it works very well.	Positive
6328	I solved the earlier problem.	Positive
6359	Addendum: CODE_FRAGMENT is useful for managing lengthy background tasks while displaying interim progress.	Positive
6	But sadly this is not working.	Negative
78	So, everything builds fine, but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.	Negative
90	That is what is causing your null pointer exception.	Negative
139	All attempts I've made were, in a shortcut, unsuccessful.	Negative
162	Don't use.	Negative
187	However when I try to run FILE_NAME, it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.	Negative
200	Problem: without zooming, the added content doesn't get visible.	Negative
201	in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size, but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.	Negative
256	else your GUI will be Hanged.	Negative
342	I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast.	Negative
361	But the above code doesn't work outside the ``FILE_NAME JavaAgent`` FILE_NAME of the main Agent.	Negative
436	Please note there is a bug in FILE_NAME, L996 +997.	Negative
444	I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.	Negative
448	the problem is the following.	Negative
491	When I run my client, it throws the following exception.	Negative
521	i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.	Negative
526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral
181	I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.	Neutral
183	resources/API _ NAME creation option: package required library into FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
191	While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system, most other applications can not.	Neutral
196	Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.	Neutral
204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
580	This is the first time I've encountered something like below.	Negative
583	NOT WORKING: directly compiled the src on Unix machine and used FILE_NAME files.	Negative
587	For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.	Negative
617	It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.	Negative
619	Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.	Negative

965	Not even sure what JSR that is.	Negative
994	I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.	Negative
1027	I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).	Negative
1079	I wanted to see all the files I have in my external storage, I have this library that display the text to the user, but when I'm using it to show the sub files, it says something like.	Negative
1152	A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).	Negative
648	This should read all files in the single input directory.	Neutral
650	It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Neutral
658	Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.	Neutral
663	Another option may be the Factory pattern.	Neutral
665	Of course you can combine both.	Neutral
672	You could use a kind of strategy.	Neutral
681	This way, you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.	Neutral
685	Hope it helps.	Neutral
689	You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.	Neutral
691	In some cases there is a trade that you need to do, thus you should take into account your project's requirements.	Neutral
698	Tried just to see the response.	Neutral
706	I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.	Neutral
713	I have downloaded a few Android applications from Google Play.	Neutral
714	I have got CODE_FRAGMENT code through reverse engineering tool CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
717	Is there any way to generate call graphs automatically?	Neutral
727	thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby, which can be found in here.	Neutral
731	and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.	Neutral
734	Do you have any hints to avoid this error?	Neutral
739	Thank you!	Neutral
740	Gotcha!	Neutral
744	The full story here!	Neutral
764	So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.	Neutral
778	I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.	Neutral
779	I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).	Neutral
784	The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.	Neutral
794	In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.	Neutral
810	Find out more.	Neutral
816	How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? )	Neutral
819	Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.	Neutral
822	Trust URI.	Neutral
833	CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes, they are sent in separate chunk of the request.	Neutral
838	Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.	Neutral
841	Use FileUtils from Apache commons.	Neutral
842	Using you current code, make this tweak.	Neutral
849	You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.	Neutral
858	I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
866	What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
870	CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs, not CODE_FRAGMENTs.	Neutral
877	I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.	Neutral
879	Thanks in advance.	Neutral
882	FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.	Neutral
883	What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.	Neutral
886	You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.	Neutral
888	This example compiles and runs.	Neutral
893	This is what I have so far.	Neutral
895	Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.	Neutral
897	Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.	Neutral
898	Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.	Neutral
903	Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?	Neutral
907	I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.	Neutral
911	In a word, no.	Neutral
913	I've a program test to see if the user input is a positive number and an integer.	Neutral
921	Try this.	Neutral
924	Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.	Neutral
934	convert PDF to SVG characters with font, size, x/y, etc. ( PDFBox does this ).	Neutral
937	attempt to interpret the areas as cells of rectangular tables.	Neutral
944	Something like this.	Neutral
945	The answer from @hyde is valid, but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.	Neutral
946	Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.	Neutral
948	Hibernate related maven conf.	Neutral
949	Suggestions that I found were.	Neutral
954	Regarding your 6 points.	Neutral
956	User hibernate validation 4 +.	Neutral
959	It is integrated in Hibernate 4.	Neutral
967	You do that explicitly, but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.	Neutral
968	No, that not required/related.	Neutral
973	How do you use all these dependencies?	Neutral
976	That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.	Neutral
980	If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.	Neutral
989	Any ideas?	Neutral
1002	Also, the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.	Neutral
1005	And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1018	You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
1020	It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.	Neutral
1024	So, to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1030	Any tip?	Neutral
1032	You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1042	thanks in advance.	Neutral
1051	Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.	Neutral
1061	Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.	Neutral
1063	The source code is.	Neutral
1072	Has anyone ever tried to connect to a Yahoo Store using Yahoo API calls from Java?	Neutral
1075	I was able to figure this out.	Neutral

1091	If I have a array with 3 profiles.	Neutral
1094	Any ideas are appreciated.	Neutral
1107	No-one's picked this up, but why are you trying to mock private methods?	Neutral
1111	Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.	Neutral
1124	jMock, mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.	Neutral
1128	Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009, that is! )	Neutral
1133	Here is a code that I have written.	Neutral
1134	When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.	Neutral
1142	See the documentation of FileWriter.	Neutral
1149	You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1160	Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.	Neutral
1166	you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1168	for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.	Neutral
1175	Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page, which would sleep for 5 seconds, then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.	Neutral
1177	Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?	Neutral
1180	Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.	Neutral
1184	On the client side, you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.	Neutral
1191	You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME, something like this.	Neutral
1193	Hope that helps.	Neutral
1199	to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).	Neutral
1205	Here it is.	Neutral
1206	Declare below string FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1208	This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.	Neutral
1212	or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.	Neutral
1221	You can try and do nothing about it.	Neutral
1224	( Come on, put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here, as suggested by @BaileyS. )	Neutral
1231	Only unchecked exception, compiler can skip to check.	Neutral
1240	There are 3 things you can do.	Neutral
1275	The short instruction is.	Neutral
1277	Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.	Neutral
1281	Suppose to have an FILE_NAME, say CODE_FRAGMENT, and two non-abstract subclasses, say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1283	E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
1284	which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.	Neutral
1285	Finally, if I try to deserialize as follows.	Neutral
1294	I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.	Neutral
1297	API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.	Neutral
743	Problem solved.	Positive
808	I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.	Positive
823	It will do the correct, ``legal ''stuff.	Positive
910	There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Positive
1011	But in the main case it works good enough.	Positive
1017	Stable and production ready lib.	Positive
1036	Not an extremely expensive operation I think.	Positive
1100	because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.	Positive
1102	This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.	Positive
1103	Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
1167	This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.	Positive
1171	They both seem to print out the list fine.	Positive
1320	Well a solution that works for me.	Positive
1223	That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).	Negative
1230	AS I know, it's impossible in the case.	Negative
1244	It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.	Negative
1255	You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ), by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).	Negative
1261	Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7.	Negative
1336	Your API_NAME is messed up and doesn't list dependencies properly.	Negative
1388	Without that information you have to start the debugging process by guessing.	Negative
1424	so I'm not happy with it.	Negative
1455	Connections, on the other hand, are expensive and need to be managed carefully by the application.	Negative
1504	i try to return an output ( type date ) in a web service but i receive a weird result.	Negative
1566	My previous code example used CODE_FRAGMENT to fuse the filter and map operations, but this was cumbersome and provided no advantage.	Negative
1613	At the moment I am receiving a ClassNotFoundException to API_NAME.	Negative
1617	I added it into my ANT_HOME / lib directory, but it didn't have any effect.	Negative

1663	An SQL EXCEPTION is being caught saying API_NAME: [ Microsoft ] [ ODBC Driver Manager ] Data source name not found and no default driver specified ''.	Negative
1763	If you've created your File IO and pulled from it in a weird way, you can corrupt the encoding of the key material.	Negative

1310	Change the double quotationCODE_FRAGMENT to to a single quote CODE_FRAGMENT like this.	Neutral
1316	That said, you should be using prepared statements.	Neutral
1321	I have a project that is using Apache POI, and I made sure to include all the external JARs.	Neutral
1327	You will need to provide classpath in Jar file's manifest file.	Neutral
1328	See this official doc.	Neutral
1335	When the CODE_FRAGMENT command fails, it's almost always because of one of two things.	Neutral
1337	Make sure FILE_NAME dependencies in your manifest file point to jars, relative to FILE_NAME's parent directory.	Neutral
1339	Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1341	You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).	Neutral
1343	About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder, as you suggested, that's also possible.	Neutral
1344	Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1346	It simply adds all the.	Neutral
1347	jars within lib / folder to your classpath.	Neutral
1351	i have found out that i have to read the error log.	Neutral
1359	For testing I've created a.	Neutral

1377	How to fix it?	Neutral
1381	Look the documentation of InputStream #read ( byte [ ] b ).	Neutral
1385	You should always check the return values of functions for error conditions.	Neutral

1412	I'm considering making an Android app that integrates OData also.	Neutral
1414	I'm developing a mobile application.	Neutral
1422	I did some modification and in the end it was working, but it does not support odata functionallity ( queries like $filter, $oderby,... ) and for each request I need a new instance.	Neutral
1425	Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.	Neutral
1427	So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?	Neutral
1432	The mentioned components generate a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1442	If you want content, use the CODE_FRAGMENT element ( which isn't a void element ).	Neutral
1454	As long as your configuration doesn't change, you can create the Session once at the beginning and jsut keep using it.	Neutral
1472	I created a library project, exported it to a JAR file, and added to the build path of a couple of clients.	Neutral
1482	Important is that you use the right names for packages.	Neutral
1483	They should be unique!	Neutral
1490	I'm using netbeans for FILE_NAME coding.	Neutral
1491	Additionally, the CODE_FRAGMENT is never called.	Neutral
1492	Any pointer why this keeps happening.	Neutral
1513	FILE_NAME has a few abstract methods of its own.	Neutral
1518	CODE_FRAGMENT return an instance of type CODE_FRAGMENT which also CODE_FRAGMENT, but overrides some of the methods, including CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1531	Then I see, that criteriaBuilder don't have method createCriteriaUpdate.	Neutral
1532	Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?	Neutral
1533	You might have both JPA NUMBER and JPA NUMBER persistence jars on the classpath.	Neutral

1646	If it is 1 then updateBar will be called once, if 2 then updateBar will be called twice etc..	Neutral
1655	Unrelated to that bug, but a bug still, you should not create swing components outside the event dispatch thread.	Neutral

1744	My task is the following.	Neutral
1751	Once you have the CODE_FRAGMENT, you can get to the CODE_FRAGMENT and the public and private keys.	Neutral
1754	Something along the lines of.	Neutral
1767	You need an RSA key for encryption, maybe you can switch your signature algorithm to RSA/SHA1 to avoid the need for two keys.	Neutral
1769	You do not need to do anything special.	Neutral
1772	Can you do something like this were Java is FILE_NAME library.	Neutral
1779	How should I make it to get additional string input such as another user's id?	Neutral
1780	use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral

1787	An example is as follows.	Neutral
1789	I want to list all album list from my picasa album.	Neutral
1792	Please help.	Neutral
1794	i have an arraylist of objects, each containing a year/month/day / hour property.	Neutral
1825	Any help appreciated.	Neutral
1835	You can then iterate through each departure element.	Neutral
1841	Here is an example of a row from the timetable.	Neutral
1847	Sorry, should've added more.	Neutral
1848	keyboard is what I named the Scanner.	Neutral
1849	This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.	Neutral
1850	If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?	Neutral
1853	The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.	Neutral
1856	When the line is empty, it will return an empty string, CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1861	you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.	Neutral
1865	Here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1866	And here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1871	I've separated the loop body into two statements for clarity, but it's equivalent to.	Neutral
1876	Your fields should generally be private.	Neutral
1877	Add public ``getter ''methods where necessary.	Neutral
1880	and to declare getters and setters for you fields.	Neutral
1882	And in your constructor, If you closeley look.	Neutral
1890	I want it to use id instead.	Neutral
1892	I have the same problem, I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.	Neutral
1895	then you will get CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1906	You need to inject LocalSessionFactoryBean into ObjectMapper.	Neutral
1909	I resolve it in my branch in github using CODE_FRAGMENT annotation.	Neutral

1529	It's ok.	Positive
1590	Here's a set of solutions to this challenge for both JDK types and Eclipse Collections types using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
1610	Any of the 5 options listed there should work just fine though.	Positive
1637	I can assure you it works from within a web app and also within an application using the Spring framework.	Positive

2127	It seems, that there must be some problem when genereting the response.	Negative
2128	I can successfully call my service but when generating the response, it seems to crash.	Negative
2130	But as far as I create the entitymanager - which not necessary has anything to do with the response - it crashes... ( I still respond with just 200 ).	Negative
2150	The following warning messages should be ignored, they are `false-positive 'alert messages.	Negative
2244	Since this afternoon, it have started to give an error and the process ends, leaving to process thousands of files.	Negative

1931	Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.	Neutral
1942	If you see the source code of this method you will see that.	Neutral
1948	This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.	Neutral
1950	The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.	Neutral
1951	That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE_FRAGMENT implementation.	Neutral
1967	Here is what the content of FILE_NAME ended up looking like.	Neutral
1970	What kind of a tool can I use to obfuscate/mask away my code similar to NewRelic `FILE_NAME?	Neutral
1971	I want to display only the headers of public functions.	Neutral
1983	JSTL will make the CODE_FRAGMENT tag available which can be used to iterate over you collection.	Neutral
1985	I am working on Spring MVC project in which I need to pass an object from my Controller to JSP and then I need to iterate that object and show them in a table FILE_NAME page.	Neutral
1986	Below is FILE_NAME which holds the data -.	Neutral

1993	Or there are any better approach for this?	Neutral
1994	We have a Java web application served from Apache Tomcat 6.	Neutral
1995	Our users are stored in a Windows 2008 R2 active directory.	Neutral

2074	but I get a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2076	You need to escape dot.	Neutral
2081	you have to use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2086	So, I thought I could create FILE_NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API_NAME code is in this answer.	Neutral
2088	So my Stream was finally.	Neutral
2094	The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.	Neutral
2097	Short answer.	Neutral
2101	I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.	Neutral
2102	Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2105	Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT, such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.	Neutral
2107	This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.	Neutral
2111	We want parallel treatment of our items.	Neutral
2114	More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.	Neutral
2121	I finally found my error!	Neutral
2142	You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.	Neutral
2145	What can be the reason of this warnings?	Neutral
2149	Someone saying here that.	Neutral
2151	Yes, i am using maven.	Neutral
2152	Here is my API_NAME.	Neutral
2155	Add this dependency to your API_NAME.	Neutral
2159	Write to file.	Neutral
2161	My logcat.	Neutral
2164	Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2165	CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2168	If so, you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.	Neutral
2172	An CODE_FRAGMENT is.	Neutral
2174	I have a Unix command to send email.	Neutral
2178	Please guide me on this problem.	Neutral
2185	Well... no.	Neutral
2186	CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.	Neutral
2187	That is, it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.	Neutral
2190	It depends: which type of equality do you want?	Neutral
2194	Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2195	CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.	Neutral
2196	Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
2203	Where Object is FILE_NAME you want.	Neutral
2204	I found work around from this post WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2206	First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.	Neutral
2209	Then you can consume the service and get a strongly typed list via.	Neutral
2217	Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?	Neutral
2220	From the articles I read, I kind of get the following.	Neutral
2226	for which you can specify the target directory.	Neutral
2228	If we move forward with this, this is what I envision.	Neutral
2229	If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.	Neutral
2240	2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.	Neutral
2241	3 ) Edit API_NAME configuration file ( in the `bower_component's folder ) and specify path for each js library components.	Neutral
2254	I have a native library that I call using JNI.	Neutral
2260	A few notes.	Neutral
2265	See NativeSystem.	Neutral
2269	Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.	Neutral
2270	Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.	Neutral
2272	Quite contrary, on Windows.	Neutral
2284	Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here, or.	Neutral
2287	It will read a byte each time here.	Neutral
2290	Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.	Neutral
2292	After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2293	and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.	Neutral
2295	On a sidenote.	Neutral
2312	CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.	Neutral
2315	This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).	Neutral
2322	Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding, use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.	Neutral
2323	Edit: - Missed to add one imp line, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2343	As to your point.	Neutral
2349	The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.	Neutral
2353	That shouldn't be an issue though.	Neutral
2363	It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.	Neutral
2365	Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.	Neutral
2366	You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.	Neutral
2380	And then for FILE_NAME we have.	Neutral
2382	Examples of FILE_NAME names include.	Neutral
2386	Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form.	Neutral
2387	modified_package_name / name.	Neutral
2397	Hope this helps anyone out there!	Neutral
2403	WEB_ADDRESS #setString% API_NAME,% API_NAME% 29.	Neutral
2415	Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2418	I have modified your code to add them.	Neutral
2421	Please refer to the code below.	Neutral
2423	I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.	Neutral
2425	And my Gradle File looks like this.	Neutral
2430	where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2432	If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.	Neutral
2433	So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.	Neutral
2435	I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.	Neutral
2437	InsertandRetriveBlobData.	Neutral
2456	Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.	Neutral
2461	You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.	Neutral
2463	Once you have a complete message, you need to process it.	Neutral
2470	Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage, current, temperature etc. ).	Neutral
2471	I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.	Neutral
2475	Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.	Neutral
2477	this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.	Neutral
1879	I suggest you to use.	Positive
1930	Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.	Positive
2137	This works for me.	Positive
2202	For me this worked.	Positive
2225	Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.	Positive
2231	It does its job, but was built for our use case.	Positive
2271	That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.	Positive
2364	I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.	Positive
2367	I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.	Positive
2396	So this works.	Positive
2545	In lieu of that, however, in my experience, ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity, flexibility, and ease-of-use.	Positive
2649	As others have already said, JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.	Positive
2669	There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.	Positive
2468	The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.	Negative
2479	since a day I have a very annoying problem - I can't run any Spring MVC application: / Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation.	Negative
2533	Any idea what i might be doing wrong.	Negative
2575	I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.	Negative
2578	Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.	Negative
2584	i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.	Negative
2606	I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism, as it would produce a lot of overhead.	Negative
2656	I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query, it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.	Negative
2705	Less margin for error.	Negative
2745	Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.	Negative
2796	I was unable to get a perfect match.	Negative
2824	I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally.	Negative
2841	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!	Negative
2862	There is, of course, an API for the DRL compiler's parser, but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax, which is considerable.	Negative
2872	I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.	Negative
2899	But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.	Negative
2928	This is an absurd, unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.	Negative
2938	First of all I do not think you need all these.	Negative
2480	So i created this from scratch.	Neutral
2482	and of course API_NAME.	Neutral
2490	it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.	Neutral
2493	What am I missing???	Neutral
2495	However, you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.	Neutral
2497	It's documentation can be found here.	Neutral
2506	a way to get FILE_NAME type, thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.	Neutral
2519	In a word: No.	Neutral
2522	What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?	Neutral
2523	Which one should be reported?	Neutral
2526	You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them.	Neutral
2531	Using this, i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.	Neutral
2536	Some other pointer.	Neutral
2538	I am using API_NAME for encoding.	Neutral
2540	Working Python Code.	Neutral
2541	I'm looking for a well-maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API.	Neutral
2556	Take a look at this article.	Neutral
2579	Maybe you could do the same that he did, i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?	Neutral
2580	( see: this answer ).	Neutral
2583	how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?	Neutral
2602	There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.	Neutral
2604	I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.	Neutral
2605	How is blocking performed?	Neutral
2608	No, they don't use busy-waiting.	Neutral
2609	It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.	Neutral
2611	the exception is on line 72 and 114.	Neutral
2613	Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).	Neutral
2628	This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x, hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.	Neutral
2635	One which is the Pro full API.	Neutral
2637	I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.	Neutral
2641	When you build, you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus, artifactory, etc ), and then you would have 2 separate jars.	Neutral
2643	A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.	Neutral
2644	You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.	Neutral
2645	Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.	Neutral
2650	You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method, since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.	Neutral
2661	What I would like to do, take any random XML, and create object which will contain timestamps, integers, strings as well maps, basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure.	Neutral
2665	Is there better way than to do it manually?	Neutral
2683	Component scan configuration file.	Neutral
2689	In a FILE_NAME code base in my recent job, I see the below code.	Neutral
2691	Are there examples you have that could shed light on the above MapHelper's usefulness?	Neutral
2695	you could use.	Neutral
2700	See also `Is there a Java equivalent or methodology for the typedef keyword in C++? '	Neutral
2703	They appear to have foresight about what the Map contains.	Neutral
2710	There are some examples like this in the Java API such as.	Neutral
2722	Does anyone know what the C# equivalents would be for the methods shown above?	Neutral
2724	XmlWriter, forward-only xml stream generator.	Neutral
2730	The API_NAME file code is.	Neutral
2732	When i run this API_NAME, their shows only the labels, and No button aor text field.	Neutral
2734	Wrong JSF tags.	Neutral
2741	In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).	Neutral
2744	Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2759	You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter/setter, so instead of.	Neutral
2762	Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2763	Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2765	Also to note, when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF/server/J2EE you are using ( without such information, we can not tell you which annotations you should use ).	Neutral
2770	Do i need to use event mechanism?	Neutral
2775	Use CODE_FRAGMENT instead, and get this string from a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2776	Check here for an example which returns a String.	Neutral
2777	Like this.	Neutral
2779	If you insist using CODE_FRAGMENT, you can try the below 2 ways.	Neutral
2786	Can anyone please help me out with this.	Neutral
2797	Hoping to get an alternate approach or a small overview of AnchorPane constraints.	Neutral
2798	Note: I'm new to JavaFX graphics library.	Neutral
2806	running CODE_FRAGMENT isn't enough, running CODE_FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me.	Neutral
2809	I would like to keep that original window open throughout when the user is using the File Chooser and after.	Neutral
2812	The file chooser's parent was the main window.	Neutral

2832	I created the simplest possible android app which starts the RegisterActivity generated by the plugin, where I did plug the ID, Api Key and project number.	Neutral
2833	I then click on the button but I get this error message.	Neutral
2834	Although, the console tells me that there is one instance up and running and the LOCAL_ANDROID_RUN variable in FILE_NAME is set to false.	Neutral
2836	How is that possible and what can I be doing wrong?	Neutral
2837	Thank you a lot in advance.	Neutral
2845	The same number is: 2.	Neutral
2855	Use this logic it will work for consecutive same values otherwise use ArrayList.	Neutral
2880	drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules.	Neutral
2881	What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java?	Neutral
2883	I don't know if this is the `accepted 'way, but with the following code I comine CODE_FRAGMENT files with programmatically created rules in Drools 6.	Neutral
2886	The following comment is found at the Java documentation.	Neutral
2896	Adding API_NAME ( ) after awaitTermination ( ) method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for.	Neutral
2897	I took help from this Question.	Neutral
2901	System prints data like this.	Neutral
2910	If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.	Neutral
2914	So, basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.	Neutral
2918	You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.	Neutral
2920	Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2921	It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.	Neutral
2922	UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII, two bytes for many europe languages.	Neutral
2923	Also each String object contains reference to char array.	Neutral
2926	So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2941	And then in your other file.	Neutral
2948	Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2951	But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the API_NAME.	Neutral
2959	In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.	Neutral
2963	I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.	Neutral
2983	Please see attached cause exception.	Neutral
2988	You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client, you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.	Neutral
2994	You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started.	Neutral
2995	Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here.	Neutral
2997	I am using Android Studio.	Neutral
3002	The logcat is as below.	Neutral
3003	Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?	Neutral
3007	FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.	Neutral
3015	My API_NAME seems to include the reference.	Neutral
3020	Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3029	As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,.	Neutral
3031	I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.	Neutral
3032	I have also tried to use.	Neutral
3037	( In this case I would have used.	Neutral
3050	Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.	Neutral
3055	so, how we can parse above like example expression easier, or FILE_NAME api for string parser.	Neutral
3076	This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
3080	Now I want this, when the user check a shipper by EditTextView, I have from database an Object.	Neutral
3081	I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.	Neutral
3082	Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.	Neutral
3084	So instead of setting Bundle to null, you can do something like this.	Neutral
3085	Check out this link for more info.	Neutral
3099	I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call,.	Neutral
3106	This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.	Neutral
2761	Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.	Positive
2805	Solved, in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.	Positive
2904	Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.	Positive
2907	This solution is more flexible.	Positive
2940	but if you want you can do this.	Positive
2942	I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.	Positive
2953	With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.	Positive
3173	There are many ways to solve it, the simplest is call.	Positive
3185	The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.	Positive
3226	You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.	Positive
3337	Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT, useful for quantifier syntax.	Positive
3404	The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3427	In any case, manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.	Positive
2958	This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.	Negative
2965	But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.	Negative
2971	then I gets the module error again from JNA.	Negative
2999	This line gives the error.	Negative
3024	I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.	Negative
3132	And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
3134	But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.	Negative
3172	You have problem with classpath.	Negative
3186	Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.	Negative
3214	I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.	Negative
3244	If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.	Negative
3287	does not work without previously setting the FILE_NAME.	Negative
3366	They all fail with the following error.	Negative
3382	The following is the error I keep getting.	Negative
3396	But it isn't working like I expected.	Negative
3398	But unexpectedly, I am getting 66.	Negative
3430	As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.	Negative
3569	Why is it reading it wrongly?	Negative
3107	I'm new to FILE_NAME language.	Neutral
3126	In Java, you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.	Neutral
3135	Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. )	Neutral
3145	If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java, use a FILE_NAME.	Neutral
3163	So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3193	When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.	Neutral
3212	I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.	Neutral
3224	Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it, loop through it, create a Comparator etc..	Neutral
3232	I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.	Neutral
3238	You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.	Neutral
3250	I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.	Neutral
3256	The program is just a hello world Program.	Neutral
3267	You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.	Neutral
3269	CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.	Neutral
3282	( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes, though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. )	Neutral
3288	Finally, ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.	Neutral
3290	So you can do.	Neutral
3294	One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.	Neutral
3300	The code in Java is.	Neutral
3302	What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.	Neutral
3321	This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.	Neutral
3322	Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3323	Are they equivalent?	Neutral
3340	I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.	Neutral
3341	They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3346	I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.	Neutral
3352	So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.	Neutral
3359	Try to download *.	Neutral
3361	May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.	Neutral
3368	Let me know if there are any other details that might help!	Neutral
3370	Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3372	Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.	Neutral
3389	Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).	Neutral
3393	For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3395	I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.	Neutral
3407	If you want to print a int as binary, use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.	Neutral
3409	Version of Spring is NUMBER.	Neutral
3410	I have a session bean, declared as.	Neutral
3413	After debugging, i found out, that when test spring context is started, in the.	Neutral
3422	You can add a util method to your test, something like.	Neutral
3426	In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3429	See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.	Neutral
3432	However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.	Neutral
3435	Obviously, the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT, but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT, etc..	Neutral
3438	Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ).	Neutral
3445	And DispatherConfig is this.	Neutral
3446	Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.	Neutral
3448	hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.	Neutral
3453	Let's put your code inside a method.	Neutral
3454	If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.	Neutral
3457	If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.	Neutral
3462	The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp, which access the Oracle database.	Neutral
3463	This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.	Neutral
3464	Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?	Neutral
3468	Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java, see if this works for you.	Neutral
3469	Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.	Neutral
3472	When I run this on Windows, the console tells me.	Neutral
3484	Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?	Neutral
3487	Note, however, it's called CODE_FRAGMENT, with a capital D.	Neutral
3492	Question 2: From the javadoc.	Neutral
3493	So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.	Neutral
3502	But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3510	What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.	Neutral
3514	Something like below,.	Neutral
3524	Hope it clarifies.	Neutral
3539	I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.	Neutral
3548	Which outputs.	Neutral
3553	I have a string like this.	Neutral
3554	Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.	Neutral
3556	url WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3557	is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?	Neutral
3564	I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.	Neutral
3568	And I got the output like this.	Neutral
3577	mm stands for minutes.	Neutral
3584	So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.	Neutral
3589	Accourding to this answer.	Neutral
3592	IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.	Neutral
3596	and call the client as follows.	Neutral
3598	The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.	Neutral
3599	API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.	Neutral
3600	Please see the following sample code.	Neutral
3605	en-dash & em-dash word count differs from MS-Office.	Neutral
3616	Hi I have a sample log file here.	Neutral
3630	The API_NAME ( String regex,.	Neutral
3632	You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.	Neutral
3634	The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.	Neutral
3656	To stop this runnable, you have to call this when needed.	Neutral
3661	And a string contains the name of the enum.	Neutral
3665	You have to do it like this.	Neutral
3666	Here's an alternative way.	Neutral
3669	Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.	Neutral
3683	Here is the actual data sent.	Neutral
3703	I think you also have to look at the database configuration.	Neutral
3709	The package gets deleted in the registry.	Neutral
3719	install4j transforms entered package names to path names, so ''.''	Neutral
3730	Using FILE_NAME I can do something like this.	Neutral
3737	Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated.	Neutral
3739	If call is successful, the onResponse ( ) method is called.	Neutral
3740	If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.	Neutral
3743	I'm trying to inject a DAO using @Autowire.	Neutral
3750	Any advice is welcome.	Neutral
3752	FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).	Neutral
3753	Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.	Neutral
3755	You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.	Neutral
3758	In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?	Neutral
3759	I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work, scope wise.	Neutral
3761	I am curious about the problem I have proposed.	Neutral
3768	Thank you in advance!	Neutral
3772	That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.	Neutral
3780	But, i didn't give me the thing i need!	Neutral
3781	How can i do that?	Neutral
3785	Since CODE_FRAGMENT is a meta character, and it's have a special meaning in regex.	Neutral
3788	What method should I use to update existing ldap objects?	Neutral
3790	Person repo interface.	Neutral
3797	I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.	Neutral
3811	What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?	Neutral
3824	You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.	Neutral
3844	If so, then how far does this go; for example, could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?	Neutral
3847	I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.	Neutral
3480	The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.	Positive
3547	The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.	Positive
3560	It seems, after a quick google search, that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3562	This might prove to be useful unbescape.	Positive
3635	Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length, the simplest solution is.	Positive
3922	There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.	Positive
3941	Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.	Positive
4055	That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.	Positive
4126	And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.	Positive
4261	Ok, I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).	Positive
4423	Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.	Positive
4570	That's correct behavior.	Positive
4651	I finally managed to get it to work.	Positive
3622	The error is as shown below.	Negative
3623	Exception in thread ``main`` API_NAME: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type.	Negative
3639	I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.	Negative
3679	The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.	Negative
3681	I tried the following and it returns nothing.	Negative
3798	I searched a lot but i not found any solution.	Negative
3842	What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?	Negative
3848	When I tried to compile the tool, I get n error.	Negative
3853	I don't know what else to do to make things to work.	Negative
3897	I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.	Negative
3927	I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ), but it is not displaying.	Negative
3935	I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT, but there is none.	Negative
3965	but still nothing.	Negative
4040	But it's not necessary for our case.	Negative
4079	Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.	Negative
4109	I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.	Negative
4141	I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.	Negative
4149	I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.	Negative
3851	I also have set JAVA_HOME.	Neutral
3855	Use full path in ANT_HOME, eg.	Neutral
3856	It dependes where it is exactly located.	Neutral
3865	Thanks and Greeting!	Neutral
3872	So the question is.	Neutral
3887	If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ), they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.	Neutral
3888	This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.	Neutral
3894	try this type code.	Neutral
3899	In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.	Neutral
3901	and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).	Neutral
3905	If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.	Neutral
3907	If you need to shorten the button code, Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.	Neutral
3909	Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.	Neutral
3915	You can use syntax like.	Neutral
3916	I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.	Neutral
3919	In your code, you need to replace.	Neutral
3920	Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.	Neutral
3921	Which creates the file writer in append mode, see the docs here.	Neutral
3928	Here is a MacOSX MenuBar.	Neutral
3929	Below is my code.	Neutral
3931	I am running the program as a Java Application.	Neutral
3937	Some technical details.	Neutral
3938	I am using Java SE version NUMBER.	Neutral
3939	My computer's OS is Mac OS X NUMBER.	Neutral
3948	You can see in the code above I use this to call my bean in the other proyect.	Neutral
3950	I also tried using this.	Neutral
3959	Wildfly Developer Guide.	Neutral
3963	The code i am using is.	Neutral
3966	Assume you have this directory layout.	Neutral
3983	What's happening?	Neutral
3992	I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.	Neutral
3993	It started about a month ago, after a deployment.	Neutral
4001	CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.	Neutral
4004	As part of GC, first minor GC is triggered.	Neutral
4007	I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?	Neutral
4013	So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.	Neutral
4018	You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4020	Also, based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject, the unit is milliseconds, not seconds.	Neutral
4021	Try these longer term things in the long term.	Neutral
4022	If you can, try the G1GC collector.	Neutral
4023	You are using Java 7, so if you can in your current environment, give it a try.	Neutral
4024	It's meant for performance with big heaps.	Neutral
4030	Remember, the bigger the heap, the longer the garbage collector takes, irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.	Neutral
4031	You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.	Neutral
4038	Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.	Neutral
4043	At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4046	You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints, and still receive compile-time verification.	Neutral
4047	One way would be.	Neutral
4050	FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.	Neutral
4052	( If you're not using Java 8, it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one, and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )	Neutral
4054	You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4060	Thanks alot!	Neutral
4062	So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name, not price, the 2nd will changed as well, but not the opposite!	Neutral
4064	Runnable example ( adapted from answer to your previous question ).	Neutral
4066	I want update text by line number,.	Neutral
4067	for E.g. I want to change text in number 2 into.	Neutral
4070	I have to implement gtalk like chat application using UDP FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4075	Check TextSamplerDemo.	Neutral
4078	Chat window using JTextPane no images though.	Neutral
4082	The unicode for white smiling face is\ u263A.	Neutral
4088	Adding API_NAME-api-API_NAME resolved my NoClassDefFoundError.	Neutral
4089	FILE_NAME does not get listed in the maven dependency tree.	Neutral
4107	iml file if anyone is curious how Intellij is viewing this module.	Neutral
4108	I develop Cursive.	Neutral
4130	NUMBER mapping-file, FILE_NAME-file, FILE_NAME, exclude-unlisted-classes.	Neutral
4132	So I obtained the following project structure.	Neutral
4133	I modified the ``API_NAME ''file.	Neutral
4168	safety and scope beans to current thread.	Neutral
4172	As you can see some of the code is generated at runtime in methods by CGLib enhancer.	Neutral
4175	Any suggestions or interesting links appreciated!	Neutral
4178	And all injections occurs just once - on application starting.	Neutral
4182	Let's find out, how scoped beans do work.	Neutral
4189	Now, about scoped proxies.	Neutral
4191	This means, that every time you will operate on the exact same object, that was originally injected on start.	Neutral
4194	To do it, as said in documentation, declare you bean as proxified.	Neutral
4197	CODE_FRAGMENT working almost same way.	Neutral
4204	The text file has 10 lines of data and each line contains a piece of data in the format of: ``Integer1-String1: String2 ''example:`` 123-ABC: DEFG''.	Neutral
4212	You might want to create a FILE_NAME for your data.	Neutral
4224	Obtain the raw lines and keep them in a ( Clojure ) lazy sequence.	Neutral
4247	On the right side of notification android is showing time.	Neutral
4252	Refer more than here: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
4257	Currently, I create the index like so.	Neutral
4260	Any help will be greatly appreciated.	Neutral
4263	Create your index like so.	Neutral
4264	And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.	Neutral
4266	To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.	Neutral
4274	Why not?	Neutral
4277	What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.	Neutral
4278	It isn't, not at least at JPA level.	Neutral
4283	This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.	Neutral
4284	( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).	Neutral
4292	Currently, I have a method.	Neutral
4293	The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.	Neutral
4307	CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).	Neutral
4310	There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory, so you're done.	Neutral
4313	All of that can just go.	Neutral
4327	I have set up the Interface as follows.	Neutral
4330	where mOut is an ActivityInterface.	Neutral
4332	If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4341	Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.	Neutral
4353	That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int, int ) can not be referenced from a static context '', because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.	Neutral
4358	Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.	Neutral
4362	I inject the beans with AutowireHelper.	Neutral
4378	Recently, I tried to implement the AppBarLayout with tabs.	Neutral
4380	I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4382	And here is the result in an emulator.	Neutral
4385	Here is the XML layout.	Neutral
4386	There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.	Neutral
4387	WEB_ADDRESS #UNWRAP_ROOT_VALUE - see FILE_NAME #WRAP_ROOT_VALUE as well.	Neutral
4389	Config example for spring is available at.	Neutral
4391	I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.	Neutral
4395	How do I achieve this?	Neutral
4398	Is there a configuration for Jackson/Spring that I am missing?	Neutral
4400	The complete error message is.	Neutral
4401	Just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4403	I tried below code and I got this output.	Neutral
4409	HashSet ( Java Platform SE 8 ) says.	Neutral
4413	We have a requirement to show only -LCB- RED, BLUE -RCB- in a certain user interface?	Neutral
4415	see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4652	Thank you dunni for your help, you've put me on the right path.	Positive
4654	And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.	Positive
4710	but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.	Positive
4711	Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.	Positive
4737	FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.	Positive
4847	This answer describes what is happening more clearly.	Positive
4853	For example, the following works great.	Positive
4897	It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.	Positive
4982	Comparison time should be fast, so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.	Positive
5005	Congratulations.	Positive
5007	Databases are much better at handling data than Java.	Positive
5008	Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster, with less CPU, less memory and less network traffic.	Positive
5015	Embrace the Joy of Sets!	Positive
4167	I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib, but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.	Negative
4275	This is your problem.	Negative
4295	This is not my intention.	Negative
4333	I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.	Negative
4551	This isn't valid Java.	Negative
4578	Well, the funny part is, we do not know.	Negative
4596	The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.	Negative
4636	This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.	Negative
4637	The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4645	I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.	Negative
4698	The problem is that you wrote.	Negative
4775	I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4812	I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4813	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.	Negative
4841	CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.	Negative
4861	Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.	Negative
4869	I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.	Negative
4940	Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.	Negative
4420	See from Javadocs of String #compareTo.	Neutral
4422	I have a service which writes input stream to a file.	Neutral
4426	FILE_NAME: 30 line is basically CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4429	As I read more into the article, I see that there is an API that looks like this.	Neutral
4430	If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).	Neutral
4431	Would I in theory, be able to send a notification with whatever information I want to that device?	Neutral
4442	If you use the XMPP protocol.	Neutral
4443	You should implement a connection server that manages the connection to FCM to handle upstream and downstream messages.	Neutral
4453	Applet and JSP Communication.	Neutral
4454	I have tomcat hosting my website FILE_NAME api for database management.	Neutral
4458	Anyone have any idea on the problem?	Neutral
4462	I know the question is very broad but please help me thanks.	Neutral
4469	You can read more about it here.	Neutral
4470	i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.	Neutral
4477	Either pass 4 digit year or fix your pattern.	Neutral
4478	Maybe i found a solution to your problem.	Neutral
4485	Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core, tomcat-embed-websocket, tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )	Neutral
4489	Thanks in advance!	Neutral
4490	I am writing a cloud-sync application in Java with.	Neutral
4496	P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.	Neutral
4498	Thank you for any hint.	Neutral
4499	I just found a solution for Java NUMBER + in combination with native and jni dlls.	Neutral
4507	In my CODE_FRAGMENT script I have.	Neutral
4508	The repository description on MVNrepository lists several compile dependencies, including Selenium-Chrome-Driver, Selenium-FirefoSMILE_FACEriver, etc..	Neutral
4513	The image below shows that it's being compiled from the Maven script.	Neutral
4516	So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver, you need to.	Neutral
4522	How to do that is explained here.	Neutral
4527	You don't have to base64-encode the access token before use.	Neutral
4532	Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.	Neutral
4544	Concept of atomicity comes when something is mutable.	Neutral
4556	The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.	Neutral
4568	When you add 3 hours, you will get March 30, 2010 02:00 UTC.	Neutral
4572	Precisely at March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC, so March 30, 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30, 2010: 01:59 CEST, but March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30, 2010 03:00 CEST.	Neutral
4575	In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.	Neutral
4580	That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying, otherwise you risk an ambiguity.	Neutral
4583	Here is an example ( please, note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).	Neutral
4588	When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!	Neutral
4590	Where is my mistake?	Neutral
4600	I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.	Neutral
4602	You might do something like this.	Neutral
4613	Omitted time zone.	Neutral
4615	Should have been translated to UTC time.	Neutral
4619	Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4620	No Midnight.	Neutral
4624	Some comments about this source code.	Neutral
4626	Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.	Neutral
4647	EAR dependencies.	Neutral
4648	The datasource should load from jndi, this is my API_NAME.	Neutral
4653	And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4659	i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.	Neutral
4666	You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.	Neutral
4671	I want to ask some questions.	Neutral
4677	( My question is here, how to list the music on JScrollPane?? )	Neutral
4679	If i double click each music ( sample1, sample2 ), the music that I choose is playing.	Neutral
4682	I want the music's name that I choose.	Neutral
4684	like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )	Neutral
4689	I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4699	But you should have written.	Neutral
4700	I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7,.	Neutral
4701	I can send POST request with this code.	Neutral
4713	Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.	Neutral
4714	startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusive.	Neutral
4717	To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.	Neutral
4726	Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.	Neutral
4727	This is a list in python.	Neutral
4728	This is how the slice operator would work.	Neutral
4746	OutputRaw solve me issue.	Neutral
4747	I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).	Neutral
4749	Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..	Neutral
4752	So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4761	The output that I get is -.	Neutral
4770	The statement should have been.	Neutral
4779	Here is what I have now.	Neutral
4780	Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!	Neutral
4783	ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).	Neutral
4788	That said, you have a couple options.	Neutral
4789	You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.	Neutral
4793	This would look like.	Neutral
4795	I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.	Neutral
4796	Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.	Neutral
4814	Just delete the method.	Neutral
4815	CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.	Neutral
4817	Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4823	Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).	Neutral
4826	I cant use Date format,, only string.	Neutral
4835	Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).	Neutral
4842	But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.	Neutral
4843	More details in thread.	Neutral
4848	In my case, I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.	Neutral
4859	The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.	Neutral
4863	Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.	Neutral
4865	can not be cast to API_NAME.	Neutral
4873	The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.	Neutral
4874	---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.	Neutral
4875	I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here, such as Velocity and FreeMarker.	Neutral
4883	The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).	Neutral
4885	I have 2D closed vector paths, specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.	Neutral
4905	I expect to do a system when you can do a survey, and then, press a button, open a new activity and see survey answers.	Neutral
4908	Here is my code of the survey, XML and JAVA.	Neutral
4913	like this just capture all user input data, No need for the database in this.	Neutral
4914	Here list is the list of all question you are having....	Neutral
4916	getQuestion and similarly with answer.	Neutral
4918	I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.	Neutral
4924	In this situation, when I click on the greyed out widget, I need to start the app.	Neutral
4926	how I could achieve this.	Neutral
4930	You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4948	Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.	Neutral
4949	Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT, because the latter only processes public fields.	Neutral
4953	Let's assume my model looks like this.	Neutral
4957	I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.	Neutral
4961	Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.	Neutral
4966	Plese guide.	Neutral
4967	Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required, NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).	Neutral
4968	Targetting to achieve.	Neutral
4969	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string, e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4970	If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.	Neutral
4984	New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.	Neutral
4990	Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4996	Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.	Neutral
5026	I understand the boolean expression here.	Positive
5052	If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way, try CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5073	This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.	Positive
5244	Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.	Positive
5262	it's worth a shot.	Positive
5324	I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.	Positive
5381	It's really good.	Positive
5382	It's an excellent, fast library.	Positive
5408	At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.	Positive
5497	check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.	Positive
5518	This works fine.	Positive
5600	It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5626	The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.	Positive
4942	Because it's not initialized yet.	Negative
4945	( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
4947	I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT, but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.	Negative
5101	Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.	Negative
5128	Data loss.	Negative
5219	When I run the project, I get the following error,.	Negative
5256	As you can see, the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering, it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.	Negative
5307	As others have stated, this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.	Negative
5310	We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.	Negative
5364	All seems OK, but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).	Negative
5385	... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.	Negative
5409	I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
5478	( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )	Negative
5542	It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.	Negative
5567	I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5607	Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work, unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.	Negative
5623	There is a caveat with the above approach.	Negative
5636	It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.	Negative
5003	Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT, iterating the submap, giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.	Neutral
5016	Hmmm.	Neutral
5027	But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?	Neutral
5030	So you can see, since CODE_FRAGMENT, exception is not thrown.	Neutral
5034	Can you help in understanding this code.	Neutral
5035	Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.	Neutral
5056	In the code you referenced, readLine is called on a BufferedReader.	Neutral
5061	An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.	Neutral
5063	The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.	Neutral
5071	In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.	Neutral
5078	Here's an example of a JSON structure.	Neutral
5079	Here it's the function that parses the json.	Neutral
5082	I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic, I don't always know what structure will come from it.	Neutral
5087	Can I use a recursive function?	Neutral
5093	Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.	Neutral
5113	Consider the following interface.	Neutral
5114	Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.	Neutral
5115	Now consider the following FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5122	Avoid legacy date-time classes.	Neutral
5129	The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.	Neutral
5133	Instead, use API_NAME classes.	Neutral
5135	When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT, immediately convert to API_NAME types.	Neutral
5137	In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7, use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5138	An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
5141	API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.	Neutral
5144	To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial.	Neutral
5146	Specification is JSR 310.	Neutral
5161	Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?	Neutral
5165	Use it.	Neutral
5168	You probably mean.	Neutral
5172	e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5173	I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.	Neutral
5174	The regex is.	Neutral
5176	I am using this.	Neutral
5184	You can use this regex.	Neutral
5185	You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.	Neutral
5196	If so, please show an example.	Neutral
5203	What is best practice while testing Android Services?	Neutral
5208	After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process, following the instructions from here, I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.	Neutral
5218	I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below,.	Neutral
5220	I took several measures,.	Neutral
5223	What should I do to solve the issue?	Neutral
5225	I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.	Neutral
5233	How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?	Neutral
5257	Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?	Neutral
5258	Graphics Initialization.	Neutral
5260	I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.	Neutral
5267	See here.	Neutral
5275	url: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5284	I've given an example below.	Neutral
5293	There are several options.	Neutral
5295	Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.	Neutral
5317	Since that time we've tended more toward option two.	Neutral
5322	I will post it here if I find anything new.	Neutral
5325	But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.	Neutral
5333	you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.	Neutral
5339	and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.	Neutral
5342	There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.	Neutral
5344	This is especially true for long lived callbacks.	Neutral
5347	Otherwise, it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.	Neutral
5359	Here is the code that does the push.	Neutral
5365	Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).	Neutral
5370	For the records, I found it ;o).	Neutral
5372	For deails see Adobe forums thread.	Neutral
5374	Enjoy and thank you for your time!	Neutral
5378	FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.	Neutral
5392	Or simply use Maven repository.	Neutral
5394	Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.	Neutral
5395	Add other jars from your JDK.	Neutral
5397	All projects will see the changed JRE definition.	Neutral
5437	See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.	Neutral
5438	( And please reformat your code ).	Neutral
5446	The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.	Neutral
5448	The customer leaves the salon.	Neutral
5450	If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.	Neutral
5454	I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.	Neutral
5463	You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.	Neutral
5464	As long as the customer does not enter the saloon, it holds NotSleeping.	Neutral
5480	Here's an example.	Neutral
5484	In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.	Neutral
5489	Use FILE_NAME instead of float.	Neutral
5490	And use Java code like this.	Neutral
5491	I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5498	If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.	Neutral
5500	For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
5505	How can i solve it.	Neutral
5509	Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it, the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5512	Well, you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5517	You have to new it up.	Neutral
5519	Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT, this will help.	Neutral
5523	I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.	Neutral
5525	The FILE_NAME looks like this.	Neutral
5537	Check if your Table has that style bit.	Neutral
5539	I added.	Neutral
5548	Here is an example in Java.	Neutral
5551	To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5552	Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.	Neutral
5559	After the request is done, all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.	Neutral
5561	The output looks like this.	Neutral
5563	When that is ready I shall post the code.	Neutral
5565	An usage example.	Neutral
5582	While I would expect.	Neutral
5593	To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.	Neutral
5613	Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.	Neutral
5615	In a similar manner, you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.	Neutral
5635	my beans are destroyed, How on startup I can get the same bean registered.	Neutral
5637	As of JUnit there shouldnt be a dependency for your build, right?	Neutral
5640	I Add Junit >> > right click on project - > properties - > Java Build Path - > libraries - > add library.	Neutral
5643	Warning is -.	Neutral
5653	My code follows.	Neutral
5657	Use the SVN Kit library instead.	Neutral
5683	So in other words, it would be a bug to recieve a non workday in this example.	Neutral
5684	Store the valid strings in a CODE_FRAGMENT, and decide whether a string is a valid day or not based on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5692	Let me know if you need more details.	Neutral
5700	I know its an old post, but I believe following result will be still interesting.	Neutral
5702	The table below shows time required by simple loop and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5708	I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.	Neutral
5720	May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?	Neutral
5724	I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.	Neutral
5658	Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.	Positive
5668	But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.	Positive
5671	I still think it's not the best design, but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.	Positive
5680	Or since in NUMBER% of cases, day will be correct.	Positive
5685	The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.	Positive
5694	Even in your own parsing approach, you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.	Positive
5707	This should almost be obvious.	Positive
5731	The application is complete and working fine.	Positive
5792	And this code worked.	Positive
5867	Working Configuration.	Positive
5903	There is a solution to your problem.	Positive
5916	This configuration works very well.	Positive
5924	( Hopefully with a good example. )	Positive
5649	If I run the code in the GUI, it just hangs.	Negative
5655	I have looked and found that there are some packages that would automatically enter my keyring on login but that isn't really an option.	Negative
5670	When I first saw it, I was horrified.	Negative
5718	Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve, though.	Negative
5791	This code failed.	Negative
5803	You can not supply system properties to the API_NAME tool, unfortunately.	Negative
5812	I have found out that certain misconfigured servers send an ``Unrecognized Name ''warning in the SSL handshake which is ignored by most clients... except for Java.	Negative
5878	You can't open CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5887	This is an issue with how volley handles HTTPUrlConnection and retry policy.	Negative
5964	So it's basically in the wrong form.	Negative
5996	Avoid them.	Negative
6114	This may or may not work.	Negative
6309	On Facebook i ran in to a problem.	Negative
6316	The result was the same that i don't have the correct permissions.	Negative
6326	I am new to this so maybe i'm doing somthing wrong.	Negative
6329	And now my app is getting it's app Token and i can use it to publish messages but the problem is those messages can not be viewed on the app page it self.	Negative
6378	There's no way to do that, AFAIK.	Negative
6385	You can't suspend a thread like that.	Negative
5726	There is a dynamic templating component that is moving from the tapx component library to core Tapestry in NUMBER.	Neutral
5728	Here is a brief description of it.	Neutral
5732	A small description of application is as follow.	Neutral
5733	The application is basically an object manager, where user add new object, remove old objects and connect object with each other.	Neutral
5738	What Left.	Neutral
5744	cricle and fill that with red.	Neutral
5752	However, I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..	Neutral
5753	Using this you'd basically only have to define your object graph.	Neutral
5761	can someone help me how to do this with a piece of code.	Neutral
5777	Thanks in advance to everyone.	Neutral
5779	You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.	Neutral
5780	This website shows how.	Neutral
5789	I had what I believe the same issue is.	Neutral
5790	I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.	Neutral
5795	Was being sent from the server to the client.	Neutral
5801	If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).	Neutral
5806	UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.	Neutral
5815	To allow your programs to work without re-compiling, run your app as.	Neutral
5827	When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ), retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT, but this time without a host name.	Neutral
5842	Alarmingly, my customer has discovered a setting in the Java control panel which resolves this.	Neutral
5849	Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.	Neutral
5862	Restart your Tomcat ( important ).	Neutral
5863	Just to add a solution here.	Neutral
5868	My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.	Neutral
5877	The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.	Neutral
5880	Btw, you can also try apache http components.	Neutral
5900	You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.	Neutral
5905	here is an example hot to use countdownlatch.	Neutral
5908	If you have access to the configuration of your EJB container and you can set the executor, then you could Guava's addCallback method.	Neutral
5911	Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService, so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.	Neutral
5915	I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.	Neutral
5933	Basically, the component type is mandatory for JSF in order to create the component by CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
5936	The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5944	tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.	Neutral
5951	I have just a quick question: Are files created before they are finished, or are they finished and then created?	Neutral
5966	How do I get this string into the form of a JSONArray so that I can access it's elements.	Neutral
5971	I'm printing a String.	Neutral
5977	In the below code, a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.	Neutral
5978	So, the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.	Neutral
5983	The book time should be from 20:00 -6:00.	Neutral
5984	whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.	Neutral
6001	The length of the appointments, the span of time not yet attached to the timeline, should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6004	Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT, FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.	Neutral
6007	For example, 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN, and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.	Neutral
6008	You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.	Neutral
6018	CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.	Neutral
6024	When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time, combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6030	Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.	Neutral
6031	Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.	Neutral
6032	We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.	Neutral
6036	The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
6038	Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.	Neutral
6040	We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
6048	The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration API_NAME.	Neutral
6057	Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?	Neutral
6059	With CODE_FRAGMENT, this example took NUMBER seconds with the option on and NUMBER second with it off in Java 6 update 29.	Neutral
6064	( Should be visible in a couple of days ).	Neutral
6067	It seems Oracle really removed the option.	Neutral

6192	What is a CODE_FRAGMENT and what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6203	Jar file check following link.	Neutral
6205	Hope it will help you.	Neutral
6218	So what do you think?	Neutral
6221	Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.	Neutral
6222	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6224	Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.	Neutral
6225	It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.	Neutral
6229	Since this is homework, here's some hints.	Neutral
6236	To clarify, a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.	Neutral
6240	Let's look at a sample call.	Neutral
6248	You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!	Neutral
6254	and finally here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
6273	Assuming instance variables, frst way, EC, CC, PT are ZERO.	Neutral
6280	CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.	Neutral
6289	No, it's not the same.	Neutral
6294	only HC will be initialized.	Neutral
6295	all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).	Neutral
6298	You can also do it as follows.	Neutral
6299	First declare all variables.	Neutral
6300	Then assign value.	Neutral
6302	If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC, CC, PT and HC values are one.	Neutral
6304	Documentation: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
6305	I'm trying to post comments on an app page in Facebook.	Neutral
6310	From what i have found the only API that is almost up to date is RestFB.	Neutral
6319	Is this api up to date?	Neutral
6321	Furthermore is there any other better api?	Neutral
6325	Here is the code that i am using to post a comment.	Neutral
6330	I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.	Neutral
6331	Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?	Neutral
6340	#NAME?	Neutral
6347	I tried something like this.	Neutral
6348	The result was byte [ ].	Neutral
6356	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.	Neutral
6358	As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.	Neutral
6361	Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components, and the progress bar can be customized.	Neutral
6363	Say, after several text appended to a text area, I want this to be appended.	Neutral
6364	``Please wait, a download is in progress ''.	Neutral
6365	After that a download progress status with progress meter character '#' gets appended.	Neutral
5927	The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.	Positive
5990	Also, JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler.	Positive
6077	The option reduces heap usage.	Positive
6080	For workloads that are memory capacity constrained ( i.e. have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time ), this option can prove useful.	Positive
6089	CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example, instead of copying.	Positive

4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral

204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral

239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral

355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral

528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive

1152	A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).	Negative
648	This should read all files in the single input directory.	Neutral
650	It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Neutral
658	Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.	Neutral
663	Another option may be the Factory pattern.	Neutral
665	Of course you can combine both.	Neutral
672	You could use a kind of strategy.	Neutral
681	This way, you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.	Neutral
685	Hope it helps.	Neutral
689	You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.	Neutral

731	and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.	Neutral
734	Do you have any hints to avoid this error?	Neutral
739	Thank you!	Neutral
740	Gotcha!	Neutral
744	The full story here!	Neutral
764	So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.	Neutral
778	I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.	Neutral
779	I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).	Neutral
784	The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.	Neutral
794	In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.	Neutral
810	Find out more.	Neutral
816	How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? )	Neutral
819	Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.	Neutral
822	Trust URI.	Neutral
833	CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes, they are sent in separate chunk of the request.	Neutral
838	Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.	Neutral
841	Use FileUtils from Apache commons.	Neutral
842	Using you current code, make this tweak.	Neutral
849	You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.	Neutral
858	I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
866	What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
870	CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs, not CODE_FRAGMENTs.	Neutral
877	I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.	Neutral
879	Thanks in advance.	Neutral
882	FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.	Neutral
883	What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.	Neutral
886	You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.	Neutral
888	This example compiles and runs.	Neutral
893	This is what I have so far.	Neutral
895	Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.	Neutral
897	Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.	Neutral
898	Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.	Neutral
903	Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?	Neutral
907	I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.	Neutral
911	In a word, no.	Neutral

921	Try this.	Neutral
924	Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.	Neutral

944	Something like this.	Neutral
945	The answer from @hyde is valid, but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.	Neutral
946	Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.	Neutral
948	Hibernate related maven conf.	Neutral
949	Suggestions that I found were.	Neutral
954	Regarding your 6 points.	Neutral
956	User hibernate validation 4 +.	Neutral
959	It is integrated in Hibernate 4.	Neutral
967	You do that explicitly, but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.	Neutral
968	No, that not required/related.	Neutral
973	How do you use all these dependencies?	Neutral
976	That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.	Neutral
980	If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.	Neutral
989	Any ideas?	Neutral
1002	Also, the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.	Neutral
1005	And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1018	You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
1020	It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.	Neutral
1024	So, to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1030	Any tip?	Neutral
1032	You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1042	thanks in advance.	Neutral
1051	Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.	Neutral
1061	Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.	Neutral

1094	Any ideas are appreciated.	Neutral
1107	No-one's picked this up, but why are you trying to mock private methods?	Neutral
1111	Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.	Neutral
1124	jMock, mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.	Neutral
1128	Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009, that is! )	Neutral
1133	Here is a code that I have written.	Neutral
1134	When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.	Neutral
1142	See the documentation of FileWriter.	Neutral
1149	You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1160	Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.	Neutral
1166	you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1168	for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.	Neutral
1175	Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page, which would sleep for 5 seconds, then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.	Neutral
1177	Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?	Neutral
1180	Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.	Neutral
1184	On the client side, you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.	Neutral
1191	You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME, something like this.	Neutral
1193	Hope that helps.	Neutral
1199	to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).	Neutral
1205	Here it is.	Neutral
1206	Declare below string FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1208	This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.	Neutral
1212	or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.	Neutral
1221	You can try and do nothing about it.	Neutral
1224	( Come on, put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here, as suggested by @BaileyS. )	Neutral
1231	Only unchecked exception, compiler can skip to check.	Neutral
1240	There are 3 things you can do.	Neutral
1275	The short instruction is.	Neutral
1277	Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.	Neutral
1281	Suppose to have an FILE_NAME, say CODE_FRAGMENT, and two non-abstract subclasses, say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1283	E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
1284	which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.	Neutral
1285	Finally, if I try to deserialize as follows.	Neutral
1294	I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.	Neutral
1297	API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.	Neutral
743	Problem solved.	Positive
808	I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.	Positive
823	It will do the correct, ``legal ''stuff.	Positive
910	There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Positive
1011	But in the main case it works good enough.	Positive
1017	Stable and production ready lib.	Positive
1036	Not an extremely expensive operation I think.	Positive
1100	because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.	Positive
1102	This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.	Positive
1103	Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
1167	This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.	Positive
1171	They both seem to print out the list fine.	Positive
1320	Well a solution that works for me.	Positive
1223	That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).	Negative
1230	AS I know, it's impossible in the case.	Negative
1244	It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.	Negative
1255	You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ), by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).	Negative
1261	Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7.	Negative
1336	Your API_NAME is messed up and doesn't list dependencies properly.	Negative

1335	When the CODE_FRAGMENT command fails, it's almost always because of one of two things.	Neutral
1337	Make sure FILE_NAME dependencies in your manifest file point to jars, relative to FILE_NAME's parent directory.	Neutral
1339	Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1341	You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).	Neutral
1343	About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder, as you suggested, that's also possible.	Neutral
1344	Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1346	It simply adds all the.	Neutral

1412	I'm considering making an Android app that integrates OData also.	Neutral
1414	I'm developing a mobile application.	Neutral
1422	I did some modification and in the end it was working, but it does not support odata functionallity ( queries like $filter, $oderby,... ) and for each request I need a new instance.	Neutral
1425	Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.	Neutral
1427	So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?	Neutral
1432	The mentioned components generate a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1442	If you want content, use the CODE_FRAGMENT element ( which isn't a void element ).	Neutral
1454	As long as your configuration doesn't change, you can create the Session once at the beginning and jsut keep using it.	Neutral
1472	I created a library project, exported it to a JAR file, and added to the build path of a couple of clients.	Neutral

1490	I'm using netbeans for FILE_NAME coding.	Neutral
1491	Additionally, the CODE_FRAGMENT is never called.	Neutral
1492	Any pointer why this keeps happening.	Neutral
1513	FILE_NAME has a few abstract methods of its own.	Neutral
1518	CODE_FRAGMENT return an instance of type CODE_FRAGMENT which also CODE_FRAGMENT, but overrides some of the methods, including CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1531	Then I see, that criteriaBuilder don't have method createCriteriaUpdate.	Neutral

1739	I am completely newbie to this topic.	Neutral
1744	My task is the following.	Neutral
1751	Once you have the CODE_FRAGMENT, you can get to the CODE_FRAGMENT and the public and private keys.	Neutral
1754	Something along the lines of.	Neutral
1767	You need an RSA key for encryption, maybe you can switch your signature algorithm to RSA/SHA1 to avoid the need for two keys.	Neutral
1769	You do not need to do anything special.	Neutral
1772	Can you do something like this were Java is FILE_NAME library.	Neutral
1779	How should I make it to get additional string input such as another user's id?	Neutral
1780	use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1786	Using CODE_FRAGMENT;.	Neutral

1789	I want to list all album list from my picasa album.	Neutral
1792	Please help.	Neutral
1794	i have an arraylist of objects, each containing a year/month/day / hour property.	Neutral
1825	Any help appreciated.	Neutral
1835	You can then iterate through each departure element.	Neutral
1841	Here is an example of a row from the timetable.	Neutral
1847	Sorry, should've added more.	Neutral
1848	keyboard is what I named the Scanner.	Neutral
1849	This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.	Neutral
1850	If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?	Neutral
1853	The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.	Neutral
1856	When the line is empty, it will return an empty string, CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1861	you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.	Neutral
1865	Here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1866	And here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1871	I've separated the loop body into two statements for clarity, but it's equivalent to.	Neutral
1876	Your fields should generally be private.	Neutral
1877	Add public ``getter ''methods where necessary.	Neutral
1880	and to declare getters and setters for you fields.	Neutral
1882	And in your constructor, If you closeley look.	Neutral
1890	I want it to use id instead.	Neutral
1892	I have the same problem, I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.	Neutral
1895	then you will get CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1906	You need to inject LocalSessionFactoryBean into ObjectMapper.	Neutral

1517	CODE_FRAGMENT overrides these methods, so there is no fear that such an Exception will be thrown.	Positive
1529	It's ok.	Positive
1590	Here's a set of solutions to this challenge for both JDK types and Eclipse Collections types using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
1610	Any of the 5 options listed there should work just fine though.	Positive
1637	I can assure you it works from within a web app and also within an application using the Spring framework.	Positive

2022	There are many errors in this code.	Negative
2026	Used wrong column names which does not exist in the table.	Negative
2041	It's ugly and inefficient but it should work.	Negative
2120	Anyway, their current behavior does not allow what you want.	Negative
2127	It seems, that there must be some problem when genereting the response.	Negative
2128	I can successfully call my service but when generating the response, it seems to crash.	Negative
2130	But as far as I create the entitymanager - which not necessary has anything to do with the response - it crashes... ( I still respond with just 200 ).	Negative

2298	Bear in mind, that the above code might not compile ( I haven't tried it out myself... ).	Negative
2399	Not sure why but I am getting following error from my FILE_NAME.	Negative
1931	Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.	Neutral
1942	If you see the source code of this method you will see that.	Neutral
1948	This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.	Neutral
1950	The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.	Neutral
1951	That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE_FRAGMENT implementation.	Neutral
1967	Here is what the content of FILE_NAME ended up looking like.	Neutral
1970	What kind of a tool can I use to obfuscate/mask away my code similar to NewRelic `FILE_NAME?	Neutral
1971	I want to display only the headers of public functions.	Neutral
1983	JSTL will make the CODE_FRAGMENT tag available which can be used to iterate over you collection.	Neutral
1985	I am working on Spring MVC project in which I need to pass an object from my Controller to JSP and then I need to iterate that object and show them in a table FILE_NAME page.	Neutral
1986	Below is FILE_NAME which holds the data -.	Neutral
1992	Do I need to use JSTL for this?	Neutral
1993	Or there are any better approach for this?	Neutral
1994	We have a Java web application served from Apache Tomcat 6.	Neutral
1995	Our users are stored in a Windows 2008 R2 active directory.	Neutral
1996	The application connects to the AD using COM4J from the API_NAME library version NUMBER.	Neutral
2004	Finally, we found the problem.	Neutral
2005	It was caused by the scenario drawn at WEB_ADDRESS of Microsoft.	Neutral
2013	I am looking to plot cluster heat maps from gene expression data that I have.	Neutral
2018	I used Matthew Beckler's Java Heat Map a while ago.	Neutral
2023	Forgot ',' in Create Table Statements.	Neutral
2036	Updated code.	Neutral
2049	use an CODE_FRAGMENT and add a FILE_NAME if not in there already.	Neutral
2054	Regex Explained.	Neutral
2056	CODE_FRAGMENT creates a capturing group, to be referenced later.	Neutral
2067	Complexity is O ( N ).	Neutral
2072	You may try like this.	Neutral
2073	I try to split the String ``NUMBER ''to 2 new Strings.	Neutral
2074	but I get a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2076	You need to escape dot.	Neutral
2081	you have to use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2086	So, I thought I could create FILE_NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API_NAME code is in this answer.	Neutral
2088	So my Stream was finally.	Neutral
2094	The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.	Neutral
2097	Short answer.	Neutral
2101	I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.	Neutral
2102	Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2105	Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT, such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.	Neutral
2107	This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.	Neutral
2111	We want parallel treatment of our items.	Neutral
2114	More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.	Neutral
2121	I finally found my error!	Neutral
2142	You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.	Neutral
2145	What can be the reason of this warnings?	Neutral
2149	Someone saying here that.	Neutral
2151	Yes, i am using maven.	Neutral
2152	Here is my API_NAME.	Neutral
2155	Add this dependency to your API_NAME.	Neutral
2159	Write to file.	Neutral
2161	My logcat.	Neutral
2164	Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2165	CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2168	If so, you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.	Neutral
2172	An CODE_FRAGMENT is.	Neutral
2174	I have a Unix command to send email.	Neutral
2178	Please guide me on this problem.	Neutral
2185	Well... no.	Neutral
2186	CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.	Neutral
2187	That is, it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.	Neutral
2190	It depends: which type of equality do you want?	Neutral
2194	Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2195	CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.	Neutral
2196	Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
2203	Where Object is FILE_NAME you want.	Neutral
2204	I found work around from this post WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2206	First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.	Neutral
2209	Then you can consume the service and get a strongly typed list via.	Neutral
2217	Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?	Neutral
2220	From the articles I read, I kind of get the following.	Neutral
2226	for which you can specify the target directory.	Neutral
2228	If we move forward with this, this is what I envision.	Neutral
2229	If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.	Neutral
2240	2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.	Neutral
2241	3 ) Edit API_NAME configuration file ( in the `bower_component's folder ) and specify path for each js library components.	Neutral
2254	I have a native library that I call using JNI.	Neutral
2260	A few notes.	Neutral
2265	See NativeSystem.	Neutral
2269	Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.	Neutral
2270	Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.	Neutral
2272	Quite contrary, on Windows.	Neutral
2284	Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here, or.	Neutral
2287	It will read a byte each time here.	Neutral
2290	Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.	Neutral
2292	After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2293	and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.	Neutral
2295	On a sidenote.	Neutral
2312	CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.	Neutral
2315	This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).	Neutral
2322	Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding, use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.	Neutral
2323	Edit: - Missed to add one imp line, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2343	As to your point.	Neutral
2349	The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.	Neutral
2353	That shouldn't be an issue though.	Neutral
2363	It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.	Neutral
2365	Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.	Neutral
2366	You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.	Neutral
2380	And then for FILE_NAME we have.	Neutral
2382	Examples of FILE_NAME names include.	Neutral
2386	Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form.	Neutral
2387	modified_package_name / name.	Neutral
2397	Hope this helps anyone out there!	Neutral
2403	WEB_ADDRESS #setString% API_NAME,% API_NAME% 29.	Neutral
2415	Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2418	I have modified your code to add them.	Neutral
2421	Please refer to the code below.	Neutral
2423	I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.	Neutral
2425	And my Gradle File looks like this.	Neutral
2430	where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2432	If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.	Neutral
2433	So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.	Neutral
2435	I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.	Neutral
2437	InsertandRetriveBlobData.	Neutral
2456	Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.	Neutral
2461	You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.	Neutral
2463	Once you have a complete message, you need to process it.	Neutral
2470	Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage, current, temperature etc. ).	Neutral
2471	I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.	Neutral
2475	Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.	Neutral
2477	this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.	Neutral
1879	I suggest you to use.	Positive
1930	Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.	Positive
2137	This works for me.	Positive
2202	For me this worked.	Positive
2225	Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.	Positive
2231	It does its job, but was built for our use case.	Positive
2271	That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.	Positive
2364	I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.	Positive
2367	I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.	Positive
2396	So this works.	Positive
2545	In lieu of that, however, in my experience, ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity, flexibility, and ease-of-use.	Positive
2649	As others have already said, JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.	Positive
2669	There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.	Positive
2468	The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.	Negative
2479	since a day I have a very annoying problem - I can't run any Spring MVC application: / Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation.	Negative
2533	Any idea what i might be doing wrong.	Negative
2575	I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.	Negative
2578	Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.	Negative
2584	i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.	Negative
2606	I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism, as it would produce a lot of overhead.	Negative
2656	I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query, it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.	Negative
2705	Less margin for error.	Negative
2745	Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.	Negative
2796	I was unable to get a perfect match.	Negative
2824	I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally.	Negative
2841	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!	Negative
2862	There is, of course, an API for the DRL compiler's parser, but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax, which is considerable.	Negative
2872	I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.	Negative
2899	But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.	Negative
2928	This is an absurd, unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.	Negative
2938	First of all I do not think you need all these.	Negative
2480	So i created this from scratch.	Neutral
2482	and of course API_NAME.	Neutral
2490	it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.	Neutral
2493	What am I missing???	Neutral
2495	However, you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.	Neutral
2497	It's documentation can be found here.	Neutral
2506	a way to get FILE_NAME type, thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.	Neutral
2519	In a word: No.	Neutral
2522	What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?	Neutral
2523	Which one should be reported?	Neutral
2526	You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them.	Neutral
2531	Using this, i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.	Neutral
2536	Some other pointer.	Neutral
2538	I am using API_NAME for encoding.	Neutral
2540	Working Python Code.	Neutral
2541	I'm looking for a well-maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API.	Neutral
2556	Take a look at this article.	Neutral
2579	Maybe you could do the same that he did, i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?	Neutral
2580	( see: this answer ).	Neutral
2583	how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?	Neutral
2602	There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.	Neutral
2604	I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.	Neutral
2605	How is blocking performed?	Neutral
2608	No, they don't use busy-waiting.	Neutral
2609	It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.	Neutral
2611	the exception is on line 72 and 114.	Neutral
2613	Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).	Neutral
2628	This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x, hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.	Neutral
2635	One which is the Pro full API.	Neutral
2637	I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.	Neutral
2641	When you build, you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus, artifactory, etc ), and then you would have 2 separate jars.	Neutral
2643	A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.	Neutral
2644	You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.	Neutral
2645	Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.	Neutral
2650	You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method, since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.	Neutral
2661	What I would like to do, take any random XML, and create object which will contain timestamps, integers, strings as well maps, basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure.	Neutral
2665	Is there better way than to do it manually?	Neutral
2683	Component scan configuration file.	Neutral
2689	In a FILE_NAME code base in my recent job, I see the below code.	Neutral
2691	Are there examples you have that could shed light on the above MapHelper's usefulness?	Neutral
2695	you could use.	Neutral
2700	See also `Is there a Java equivalent or methodology for the typedef keyword in C++? '	Neutral
2703	They appear to have foresight about what the Map contains.	Neutral
2710	There are some examples like this in the Java API such as.	Neutral
2722	Does anyone know what the C# equivalents would be for the methods shown above?	Neutral
2724	XmlWriter, forward-only xml stream generator.	Neutral
2730	The API_NAME file code is.	Neutral
2732	When i run this API_NAME, their shows only the labels, and No button aor text field.	Neutral
2734	Wrong JSF tags.	Neutral
2741	In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).	Neutral
2744	Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2759	You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter/setter, so instead of.	Neutral
2762	Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2763	Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2765	Also to note, when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF/server/J2EE you are using ( without such information, we can not tell you which annotations you should use ).	Neutral
2770	Do i need to use event mechanism?	Neutral
2775	Use CODE_FRAGMENT instead, and get this string from a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2776	Check here for an example which returns a String.	Neutral
2777	Like this.	Neutral
2779	If you insist using CODE_FRAGMENT, you can try the below 2 ways.	Neutral
2786	Can anyone please help me out with this.	Neutral
2797	Hoping to get an alternate approach or a small overview of AnchorPane constraints.	Neutral
2798	Note: I'm new to JavaFX graphics library.	Neutral
2806	running CODE_FRAGMENT isn't enough, running CODE_FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me.	Neutral
2809	I would like to keep that original window open throughout when the user is using the File Chooser and after.	Neutral
2812	The file chooser's parent was the main window.	Neutral
2817	DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE ( defined in WindowConstants ): Don't do anything; require the program to handle the operation in the windowClosing method of a registered WindowListener object.	Neutral

2834	Although, the console tells me that there is one instance up and running and the LOCAL_ANDROID_RUN variable in FILE_NAME is set to false.	Neutral
2836	How is that possible and what can I be doing wrong?	Neutral
2837	Thank you a lot in advance.	Neutral
2845	The same number is: 2.	Neutral
2855	Use this logic it will work for consecutive same values otherwise use ArrayList.	Neutral
2880	drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules.	Neutral
2881	What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java?	Neutral
2883	I don't know if this is the `accepted 'way, but with the following code I comine CODE_FRAGMENT files with programmatically created rules in Drools 6.	Neutral
2886	The following comment is found at the Java documentation.	Neutral
2896	Adding API_NAME ( ) after awaitTermination ( ) method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for.	Neutral
2897	I took help from this Question.	Neutral
2901	System prints data like this.	Neutral
2910	If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.	Neutral
2914	So, basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.	Neutral
2918	You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.	Neutral
2920	Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2921	It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.	Neutral
2922	UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII, two bytes for many europe languages.	Neutral
2923	Also each String object contains reference to char array.	Neutral
2926	So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2941	And then in your other file.	Neutral
2948	Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2951	But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the API_NAME.	Neutral
2959	In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.	Neutral
2963	I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.	Neutral
2983	Please see attached cause exception.	Neutral
2988	You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client, you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.	Neutral
2994	You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started.	Neutral
2995	Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here.	Neutral
2997	I am using Android Studio.	Neutral
3002	The logcat is as below.	Neutral
3003	Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?	Neutral
3007	FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.	Neutral
3015	My API_NAME seems to include the reference.	Neutral
3020	Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3029	As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,.	Neutral
3031	I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.	Neutral
3032	I have also tried to use.	Neutral
3037	( In this case I would have used.	Neutral
3050	Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.	Neutral
3055	so, how we can parse above like example expression easier, or FILE_NAME api for string parser.	Neutral
3076	This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
3080	Now I want this, when the user check a shipper by EditTextView, I have from database an Object.	Neutral
3081	I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.	Neutral
3082	Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.	Neutral
3084	So instead of setting Bundle to null, you can do something like this.	Neutral
3085	Check out this link for more info.	Neutral
3099	I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call,.	Neutral
3106	This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.	Neutral
2761	Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.	Positive
2805	Solved, in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.	Positive
2904	Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.	Positive
2907	This solution is more flexible.	Positive
2940	but if you want you can do this.	Positive
2942	I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.	Positive
2953	With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.	Positive
3173	There are many ways to solve it, the simplest is call.	Positive
3185	The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.	Positive
3226	You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.	Positive
3337	Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT, useful for quantifier syntax.	Positive
3404	The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3427	In any case, manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.	Positive
2958	This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.	Negative
2965	But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.	Negative
2971	then I gets the module error again from JNA.	Negative
2999	This line gives the error.	Negative
3024	I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.	Negative
3132	And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
3134	But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.	Negative
3172	You have problem with classpath.	Negative
3186	Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.	Negative
3214	I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.	Negative
3244	If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.	Negative
3287	does not work without previously setting the FILE_NAME.	Negative
3366	They all fail with the following error.	Negative
3382	The following is the error I keep getting.	Negative
3396	But it isn't working like I expected.	Negative
3398	But unexpectedly, I am getting 66.	Negative
3430	As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.	Negative
3569	Why is it reading it wrongly?	Negative
3107	I'm new to FILE_NAME language.	Neutral
3126	In Java, you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.	Neutral
3135	Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. )	Neutral
3145	If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java, use a FILE_NAME.	Neutral
3163	So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3193	When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.	Neutral
3212	I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.	Neutral
3224	Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it, loop through it, create a Comparator etc..	Neutral
3232	I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.	Neutral
3238	You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.	Neutral
3250	I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.	Neutral
3256	The program is just a hello world Program.	Neutral
3267	You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.	Neutral
3269	CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.	Neutral
3282	( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes, though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. )	Neutral
3288	Finally, ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.	Neutral
3290	So you can do.	Neutral
3294	One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.	Neutral
3300	The code in Java is.	Neutral
3302	What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.	Neutral
3321	This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.	Neutral
3322	Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3323	Are they equivalent?	Neutral
3340	I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.	Neutral
3341	They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3346	I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.	Neutral
3352	So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.	Neutral
3359	Try to download *.	Neutral
3361	May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.	Neutral
3368	Let me know if there are any other details that might help!	Neutral
3370	Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3372	Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.	Neutral
3389	Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).	Neutral
3393	For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3395	I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.	Neutral
3407	If you want to print a int as binary, use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.	Neutral
3409	Version of Spring is NUMBER.	Neutral
3410	I have a session bean, declared as.	Neutral
3413	After debugging, i found out, that when test spring context is started, in the.	Neutral
3422	You can add a util method to your test, something like.	Neutral
3426	In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3429	See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.	Neutral
3432	However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.	Neutral
3435	Obviously, the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT, but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT, etc..	Neutral
3438	Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ).	Neutral
3445	And DispatherConfig is this.	Neutral
3446	Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.	Neutral
3448	hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.	Neutral
3453	Let's put your code inside a method.	Neutral
3454	If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.	Neutral
3457	If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.	Neutral
3462	The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp, which access the Oracle database.	Neutral
3463	This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.	Neutral
3464	Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?	Neutral
3468	Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java, see if this works for you.	Neutral
3469	Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.	Neutral
3472	When I run this on Windows, the console tells me.	Neutral
3484	Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?	Neutral
3487	Note, however, it's called CODE_FRAGMENT, with a capital D.	Neutral
3492	Question 2: From the javadoc.	Neutral
3493	So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.	Neutral
3502	But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3510	What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.	Neutral
3514	Something like below,.	Neutral
3524	Hope it clarifies.	Neutral
3539	I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.	Neutral
3548	Which outputs.	Neutral
3553	I have a string like this.	Neutral
3554	Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.	Neutral
3556	url WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3557	is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?	Neutral
3564	I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.	Neutral
3568	And I got the output like this.	Neutral
3577	mm stands for minutes.	Neutral
3584	So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.	Neutral
3589	Accourding to this answer.	Neutral
3592	IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.	Neutral
3596	and call the client as follows.	Neutral
3598	The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.	Neutral
3599	API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.	Neutral
3600	Please see the following sample code.	Neutral
3605	en-dash & em-dash word count differs from MS-Office.	Neutral
3616	Hi I have a sample log file here.	Neutral
3630	The API_NAME ( String regex,.	Neutral
3632	You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.	Neutral
3634	The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.	Neutral
3656	To stop this runnable, you have to call this when needed.	Neutral
3661	And a string contains the name of the enum.	Neutral
3665	You have to do it like this.	Neutral
3666	Here's an alternative way.	Neutral
3669	Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.	Neutral
3683	Here is the actual data sent.	Neutral
3703	I think you also have to look at the database configuration.	Neutral
3709	The package gets deleted in the registry.	Neutral
3719	install4j transforms entered package names to path names, so ''.''	Neutral
3730	Using FILE_NAME I can do something like this.	Neutral
3737	Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated.	Neutral
3739	If call is successful, the onResponse ( ) method is called.	Neutral
3740	If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.	Neutral
3743	I'm trying to inject a DAO using @Autowire.	Neutral
3750	Any advice is welcome.	Neutral
3752	FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).	Neutral
3753	Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.	Neutral
3755	You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.	Neutral
3758	In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?	Neutral
3759	I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work, scope wise.	Neutral
3761	I am curious about the problem I have proposed.	Neutral
3768	Thank you in advance!	Neutral
3772	That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.	Neutral
3780	But, i didn't give me the thing i need!	Neutral
3781	How can i do that?	Neutral
3785	Since CODE_FRAGMENT is a meta character, and it's have a special meaning in regex.	Neutral
3788	What method should I use to update existing ldap objects?	Neutral
3790	Person repo interface.	Neutral
3797	I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.	Neutral
3811	What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?	Neutral
3824	You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.	Neutral
3844	If so, then how far does this go; for example, could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?	Neutral
3847	I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.	Neutral
3480	The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.	Positive
3547	The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.	Positive
3560	It seems, after a quick google search, that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3562	This might prove to be useful unbescape.	Positive
3635	Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length, the simplest solution is.	Positive
3922	There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.	Positive
3941	Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.	Positive
4055	That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.	Positive
4126	And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.	Positive
4261	Ok, I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).	Positive
4423	Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.	Positive
4570	That's correct behavior.	Positive
4651	I finally managed to get it to work.	Positive
3622	The error is as shown below.	Negative
3623	Exception in thread ``main`` API_NAME: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type.	Negative
3639	I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.	Negative
3679	The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.	Negative
3681	I tried the following and it returns nothing.	Negative
3798	I searched a lot but i not found any solution.	Negative
3842	What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?	Negative
3848	When I tried to compile the tool, I get n error.	Negative
3853	I don't know what else to do to make things to work.	Negative
3897	I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.	Negative
3927	I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ), but it is not displaying.	Negative
3935	I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT, but there is none.	Negative
3965	but still nothing.	Negative
4040	But it's not necessary for our case.	Negative
4079	Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.	Negative
4109	I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.	Negative
4141	I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.	Negative
4149	I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.	Negative
3851	I also have set JAVA_HOME.	Neutral
3855	Use full path in ANT_HOME, eg.	Neutral
3856	It dependes where it is exactly located.	Neutral
3865	Thanks and Greeting!	Neutral
3872	So the question is.	Neutral
3887	If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ), they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.	Neutral
3888	This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.	Neutral
3894	try this type code.	Neutral
3899	In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.	Neutral
3901	and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).	Neutral
3905	If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.	Neutral
3907	If you need to shorten the button code, Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.	Neutral
3909	Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.	Neutral
3915	You can use syntax like.	Neutral
3916	I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.	Neutral
3919	In your code, you need to replace.	Neutral
3920	Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.	Neutral
3921	Which creates the file writer in append mode, see the docs here.	Neutral
3928	Here is a MacOSX MenuBar.	Neutral
3929	Below is my code.	Neutral
3931	I am running the program as a Java Application.	Neutral
3937	Some technical details.	Neutral
3938	I am using Java SE version NUMBER.	Neutral
3939	My computer's OS is Mac OS X NUMBER.	Neutral
3948	You can see in the code above I use this to call my bean in the other proyect.	Neutral
3950	I also tried using this.	Neutral
3959	Wildfly Developer Guide.	Neutral
3963	The code i am using is.	Neutral
3966	Assume you have this directory layout.	Neutral
3983	What's happening?	Neutral
3992	I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.	Neutral
3993	It started about a month ago, after a deployment.	Neutral
4001	CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.	Neutral
4004	As part of GC, first minor GC is triggered.	Neutral
4007	I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?	Neutral
4013	So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.	Neutral
4018	You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4020	Also, based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject, the unit is milliseconds, not seconds.	Neutral
4021	Try these longer term things in the long term.	Neutral
4022	If you can, try the G1GC collector.	Neutral
4023	You are using Java 7, so if you can in your current environment, give it a try.	Neutral
4024	It's meant for performance with big heaps.	Neutral
4030	Remember, the bigger the heap, the longer the garbage collector takes, irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.	Neutral
4031	You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.	Neutral
4038	Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.	Neutral
4043	At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4046	You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints, and still receive compile-time verification.	Neutral
4047	One way would be.	Neutral
4050	FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.	Neutral
4052	( If you're not using Java 8, it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one, and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )	Neutral
4054	You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4060	Thanks alot!	Neutral
4062	So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name, not price, the 2nd will changed as well, but not the opposite!	Neutral

4172	As you can see some of the code is generated at runtime in methods by CGLib enhancer.	Neutral
4175	Any suggestions or interesting links appreciated!	Neutral
4178	And all injections occurs just once - on application starting.	Neutral
4182	Let's find out, how scoped beans do work.	Neutral
4189	Now, about scoped proxies.	Neutral
4191	This means, that every time you will operate on the exact same object, that was originally injected on start.	Neutral
4194	To do it, as said in documentation, declare you bean as proxified.	Neutral
4197	CODE_FRAGMENT working almost same way.	Neutral
4204	The text file has 10 lines of data and each line contains a piece of data in the format of: ``Integer1-String1: String2 ''example:`` 123-ABC: DEFG''.	Neutral
4212	You might want to create a FILE_NAME for your data.	Neutral
4224	Obtain the raw lines and keep them in a ( Clojure ) lazy sequence.	Neutral
4247	On the right side of notification android is showing time.	Neutral
4252	Refer more than here: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
4257	Currently, I create the index like so.	Neutral
4260	Any help will be greatly appreciated.	Neutral
4263	Create your index like so.	Neutral
4264	And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.	Neutral
4266	To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.	Neutral
4274	Why not?	Neutral
4277	What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.	Neutral
4278	It isn't, not at least at JPA level.	Neutral
4283	This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.	Neutral
4284	( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).	Neutral
4292	Currently, I have a method.	Neutral
4293	The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.	Neutral
4307	CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).	Neutral
4310	There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory, so you're done.	Neutral
4313	All of that can just go.	Neutral
4327	I have set up the Interface as follows.	Neutral
4330	where mOut is an ActivityInterface.	Neutral
4332	If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4341	Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.	Neutral
4353	That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int, int ) can not be referenced from a static context '', because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.	Neutral
4358	Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.	Neutral
4362	I inject the beans with AutowireHelper.	Neutral
4378	Recently, I tried to implement the AppBarLayout with tabs.	Neutral
4380	I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4382	And here is the result in an emulator.	Neutral
4385	Here is the XML layout.	Neutral
4386	There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.	Neutral
4387	WEB_ADDRESS #UNWRAP_ROOT_VALUE - see FILE_NAME #WRAP_ROOT_VALUE as well.	Neutral
4389	Config example for spring is available at.	Neutral
4391	I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.	Neutral
4395	How do I achieve this?	Neutral
4398	Is there a configuration for Jackson/Spring that I am missing?	Neutral
4400	The complete error message is.	Neutral
4401	Just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4403	I tried below code and I got this output.	Neutral
4409	HashSet ( Java Platform SE 8 ) says.	Neutral
4413	We have a requirement to show only -LCB- RED, BLUE -RCB- in a certain user interface?	Neutral
4415	see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4652	Thank you dunni for your help, you've put me on the right path.	Positive
4654	And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.	Positive
4710	but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.	Positive
4711	Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.	Positive
4737	FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.	Positive
4847	This answer describes what is happening more clearly.	Positive
4853	For example, the following works great.	Positive
4897	It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.	Positive
4982	Comparison time should be fast, so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.	Positive
5005	Congratulations.	Positive
5007	Databases are much better at handling data than Java.	Positive
5008	Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster, with less CPU, less memory and less network traffic.	Positive
5015	Embrace the Joy of Sets!	Positive
4167	I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib, but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.	Negative
4275	This is your problem.	Negative
4295	This is not my intention.	Negative
4333	I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.	Negative
4551	This isn't valid Java.	Negative
4578	Well, the funny part is, we do not know.	Negative
4596	The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.	Negative
4636	This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.	Negative
4637	The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4645	I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.	Negative
4698	The problem is that you wrote.	Negative
4775	I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4812	I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4813	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.	Negative
4841	CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.	Negative
4861	Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.	Negative
4869	I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.	Negative
4940	Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.	Negative
4420	See from Javadocs of String #compareTo.	Neutral
4422	I have a service which writes input stream to a file.	Neutral
4426	FILE_NAME: 30 line is basically CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4429	As I read more into the article, I see that there is an API that looks like this.	Neutral
4430	If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).	Neutral
4431	Would I in theory, be able to send a notification with whatever information I want to that device?	Neutral
4442	If you use the XMPP protocol.	Neutral
4443	You should implement a connection server that manages the connection to FCM to handle upstream and downstream messages.	Neutral
4453	Applet and JSP Communication.	Neutral
4454	I have tomcat hosting my website FILE_NAME api for database management.	Neutral
4458	Anyone have any idea on the problem?	Neutral
4462	I know the question is very broad but please help me thanks.	Neutral
4469	You can read more about it here.	Neutral
4470	i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.	Neutral
4477	Either pass 4 digit year or fix your pattern.	Neutral
4478	Maybe i found a solution to your problem.	Neutral
4485	Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core, tomcat-embed-websocket, tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )	Neutral
4489	Thanks in advance!	Neutral
4490	I am writing a cloud-sync application in Java with.	Neutral
4496	P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.	Neutral
4498	Thank you for any hint.	Neutral
4499	I just found a solution for Java NUMBER + in combination with native and jni dlls.	Neutral
4507	In my CODE_FRAGMENT script I have.	Neutral
4508	The repository description on MVNrepository lists several compile dependencies, including Selenium-Chrome-Driver, Selenium-FirefoSMILE_FACEriver, etc..	Neutral
4513	The image below shows that it's being compiled from the Maven script.	Neutral
4516	So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver, you need to.	Neutral
4522	How to do that is explained here.	Neutral
4527	You don't have to base64-encode the access token before use.	Neutral
4532	Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.	Neutral
4544	Concept of atomicity comes when something is mutable.	Neutral
4556	The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.	Neutral
4568	When you add 3 hours, you will get March 30, 2010 02:00 UTC.	Neutral
4572	Precisely at March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC, so March 30, 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30, 2010: 01:59 CEST, but March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30, 2010 03:00 CEST.	Neutral
4575	In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.	Neutral
4580	That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying, otherwise you risk an ambiguity.	Neutral
4583	Here is an example ( please, note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).	Neutral
4588	When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!	Neutral
4590	Where is my mistake?	Neutral
4600	I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.	Neutral
4602	You might do something like this.	Neutral
4613	Omitted time zone.	Neutral
4615	Should have been translated to UTC time.	Neutral
4619	Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4620	No Midnight.	Neutral
4624	Some comments about this source code.	Neutral
4626	Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.	Neutral
4647	EAR dependencies.	Neutral
4648	The datasource should load from jndi, this is my API_NAME.	Neutral
4653	And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4659	i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.	Neutral
4666	You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.	Neutral
4671	I want to ask some questions.	Neutral
4677	( My question is here, how to list the music on JScrollPane?? )	Neutral
4679	If i double click each music ( sample1, sample2 ), the music that I choose is playing.	Neutral
4682	I want the music's name that I choose.	Neutral
4684	like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )	Neutral
4689	I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4699	But you should have written.	Neutral
4700	I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7,.	Neutral
4701	I can send POST request with this code.	Neutral
4713	Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.	Neutral
4714	startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusive.	Neutral
4717	To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.	Neutral
4726	Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.	Neutral
4727	This is a list in python.	Neutral
4728	This is how the slice operator would work.	Neutral
4746	OutputRaw solve me issue.	Neutral
4747	I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).	Neutral
4749	Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..	Neutral
4752	So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4761	The output that I get is -.	Neutral
4770	The statement should have been.	Neutral
4779	Here is what I have now.	Neutral
4780	Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!	Neutral
4783	ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).	Neutral
4788	That said, you have a couple options.	Neutral
4789	You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.	Neutral
4793	This would look like.	Neutral
4795	I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.	Neutral
4796	Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.	Neutral
4814	Just delete the method.	Neutral
4815	CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.	Neutral
4817	Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4823	Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).	Neutral
4826	I cant use Date format,, only string.	Neutral
4835	Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).	Neutral
4842	But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.	Neutral
4843	More details in thread.	Neutral
4848	In my case, I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.	Neutral
4859	The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.	Neutral
4863	Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.	Neutral
4865	can not be cast to API_NAME.	Neutral
4873	The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.	Neutral
4874	---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.	Neutral
4875	I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here, such as Velocity and FreeMarker.	Neutral
4883	The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).	Neutral
4885	I have 2D closed vector paths, specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.	Neutral
4905	I expect to do a system when you can do a survey, and then, press a button, open a new activity and see survey answers.	Neutral
4908	Here is my code of the survey, XML and JAVA.	Neutral
4913	like this just capture all user input data, No need for the database in this.	Neutral
4914	Here list is the list of all question you are having....	Neutral
4916	getQuestion and similarly with answer.	Neutral
4918	I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.	Neutral
4924	In this situation, when I click on the greyed out widget, I need to start the app.	Neutral
4926	how I could achieve this.	Neutral
4930	You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4948	Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.	Neutral
4949	Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT, because the latter only processes public fields.	Neutral
4953	Let's assume my model looks like this.	Neutral
4957	I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.	Neutral
4961	Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.	Neutral
4966	Plese guide.	Neutral
4967	Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required, NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).	Neutral
4968	Targetting to achieve.	Neutral
4969	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string, e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4970	If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.	Neutral
4984	New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.	Neutral
4990	Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4996	Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.	Neutral
5026	I understand the boolean expression here.	Positive
5052	If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way, try CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5073	This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.	Positive
5244	Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.	Positive
5262	it's worth a shot.	Positive
5324	I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.	Positive
5381	It's really good.	Positive
5382	It's an excellent, fast library.	Positive
5408	At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.	Positive
5497	check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.	Positive
5518	This works fine.	Positive
5600	It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5626	The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.	Positive
4942	Because it's not initialized yet.	Negative
4945	( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
4947	I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT, but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.	Negative
5101	Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.	Negative
5128	Data loss.	Negative
5219	When I run the project, I get the following error,.	Negative
5256	As you can see, the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering, it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.	Negative
5307	As others have stated, this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.	Negative
5310	We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.	Negative
5364	All seems OK, but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).	Negative
5385	... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.	Negative
5409	I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
5478	( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )	Negative
5542	It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.	Negative
5567	I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5607	Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work, unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.	Negative
5623	There is a caveat with the above approach.	Negative
5636	It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.	Negative
5003	Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT, iterating the submap, giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.	Neutral
5016	Hmmm.	Neutral
5027	But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?	Neutral
5030	So you can see, since CODE_FRAGMENT, exception is not thrown.	Neutral
5034	Can you help in understanding this code.	Neutral
5035	Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.	Neutral
5056	In the code you referenced, readLine is called on a BufferedReader.	Neutral
5061	An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.	Neutral
5063	The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.	Neutral
5071	In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.	Neutral
5078	Here's an example of a JSON structure.	Neutral
5079	Here it's the function that parses the json.	Neutral
5082	I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic, I don't always know what structure will come from it.	Neutral
5087	Can I use a recursive function?	Neutral
5093	Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.	Neutral
5113	Consider the following interface.	Neutral
5114	Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.	Neutral
5115	Now consider the following FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5122	Avoid legacy date-time classes.	Neutral
5129	The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.	Neutral
5133	Instead, use API_NAME classes.	Neutral
5135	When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT, immediately convert to API_NAME types.	Neutral
5137	In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7, use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5138	An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
5141	API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.	Neutral
5144	To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial.	Neutral
5146	Specification is JSR 310.	Neutral
5161	Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?	Neutral
5165	Use it.	Neutral
5168	You probably mean.	Neutral
5172	e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5173	I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.	Neutral
5174	The regex is.	Neutral
5176	I am using this.	Neutral
5184	You can use this regex.	Neutral
5185	You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.	Neutral
5196	If so, please show an example.	Neutral
5203	What is best practice while testing Android Services?	Neutral
5208	After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process, following the instructions from here, I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.	Neutral
5218	I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below,.	Neutral
5220	I took several measures,.	Neutral
5223	What should I do to solve the issue?	Neutral
5225	I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.	Neutral
5233	How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?	Neutral
5257	Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?	Neutral
5258	Graphics Initialization.	Neutral
5260	I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.	Neutral
5267	See here.	Neutral
5275	url: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5284	I've given an example below.	Neutral
5293	There are several options.	Neutral
5295	Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.	Neutral
5317	Since that time we've tended more toward option two.	Neutral
5322	I will post it here if I find anything new.	Neutral
5325	But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.	Neutral
5333	you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.	Neutral
5339	and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.	Neutral
5342	There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.	Neutral
5344	This is especially true for long lived callbacks.	Neutral
5347	Otherwise, it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.	Neutral
5359	Here is the code that does the push.	Neutral
5365	Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).	Neutral
5370	For the records, I found it ;o).	Neutral
5372	For deails see Adobe forums thread.	Neutral
5374	Enjoy and thank you for your time!	Neutral
5378	FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.	Neutral
5392	Or simply use Maven repository.	Neutral
5394	Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.	Neutral
5395	Add other jars from your JDK.	Neutral
5397	All projects will see the changed JRE definition.	Neutral
5437	See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.	Neutral
5438	( And please reformat your code ).	Neutral
5446	The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.	Neutral
5448	The customer leaves the salon.	Neutral
5450	If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.	Neutral
5454	I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.	Neutral
5463	You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.	Neutral
5464	As long as the customer does not enter the saloon, it holds NotSleeping.	Neutral
5480	Here's an example.	Neutral
5484	In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.	Neutral
5489	Use FILE_NAME instead of float.	Neutral
5490	And use Java code like this.	Neutral
5491	I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5498	If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.	Neutral
5500	For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
5505	How can i solve it.	Neutral
5509	Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it, the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5512	Well, you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5517	You have to new it up.	Neutral
5519	Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT, this will help.	Neutral
5523	I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.	Neutral
5525	The FILE_NAME looks like this.	Neutral
5537	Check if your Table has that style bit.	Neutral
5539	I added.	Neutral
5548	Here is an example in Java.	Neutral
5551	To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5552	Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.	Neutral
5559	After the request is done, all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.	Neutral
5561	The output looks like this.	Neutral
5563	When that is ready I shall post the code.	Neutral
5565	An usage example.	Neutral
5582	While I would expect.	Neutral
5593	To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.	Neutral
5613	Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.	Neutral
5615	In a similar manner, you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.	Neutral
5635	my beans are destroyed, How on startup I can get the same bean registered.	Neutral

5702	The table below shows time required by simple loop and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5708	I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.	Neutral
5720	May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?	Neutral
5724	I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.	Neutral
5658	Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.	Positive
5668	But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.	Positive
5671	I still think it's not the best design, but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.	Positive
5680	Or since in NUMBER% of cases, day will be correct.	Positive
5685	The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.	Positive
5694	Even in your own parsing approach, you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.	Positive
5707	This should almost be obvious.	Positive
5731	The application is complete and working fine.	Positive

5670	When I first saw it, I was horrified.	Negative
5718	Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve, though.	Negative
5791	This code failed.	Negative
5803	You can not supply system properties to the API_NAME tool, unfortunately.	Negative

5726	There is a dynamic templating component that is moving from the tapx component library to core Tapestry in NUMBER.	Neutral
5728	Here is a brief description of it.	Neutral
5732	A small description of application is as follow.	Neutral
5733	The application is basically an object manager, where user add new object, remove old objects and connect object with each other.	Neutral
5738	What Left.	Neutral
5744	cricle and fill that with red.	Neutral
5752	However, I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..	Neutral
5753	Using this you'd basically only have to define your object graph.	Neutral

5777	Thanks in advance to everyone.	Neutral
5779	You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.	Neutral
5780	This website shows how.	Neutral
5789	I had what I believe the same issue is.	Neutral
5790	I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.	Neutral
5795	Was being sent from the server to the client.	Neutral
5801	If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).	Neutral
5806	UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.	Neutral
5815	To allow your programs to work without re-compiling, run your app as.	Neutral
5827	When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ), retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT, but this time without a host name.	Neutral
5842	Alarmingly, my customer has discovered a setting in the Java control panel which resolves this.	Neutral
5849	Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.	Neutral
5862	Restart your Tomcat ( important ).	Neutral
5863	Just to add a solution here.	Neutral
5868	My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.	Neutral
5877	The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.	Neutral
5880	Btw, you can also try apache http components.	Neutral
5900	You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.	Neutral
5905	here is an example hot to use countdownlatch.	Neutral
5908	If you have access to the configuration of your EJB container and you can set the executor, then you could Guava's addCallback method.	Neutral
5911	Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService, so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.	Neutral
5915	I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.	Neutral
5933	Basically, the component type is mandatory for JSF in order to create the component by CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
5936	The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5944	tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.	Neutral
5951	I have just a quick question: Are files created before they are finished, or are they finished and then created?	Neutral

5977	In the below code, a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.	Neutral
5978	So, the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.	Neutral
5983	The book time should be from 20:00 -6:00.	Neutral
5984	whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.	Neutral
6001	The length of the appointments, the span of time not yet attached to the timeline, should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6004	Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT, FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.	Neutral
6007	For example, 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN, and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.	Neutral
6008	You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.	Neutral
6018	CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.	Neutral
6024	When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time, combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6030	Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.	Neutral
6031	Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.	Neutral
6032	We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.	Neutral
6036	The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
6038	Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.	Neutral
6040	We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
6048	The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration API_NAME.	Neutral
6057	Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?	Neutral
6059	With CODE_FRAGMENT, this example took NUMBER seconds with the option on and NUMBER second with it off in Java 6 update 29.	Neutral

6190	Then what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6191	While working with netbeans I have to make a new file of category CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6192	What is a CODE_FRAGMENT and what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6203	Jar file check following link.	Neutral
6205	Hope it will help you.	Neutral
6218	So what do you think?	Neutral
6221	Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.	Neutral
6222	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6224	Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.	Neutral
6225	It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.	Neutral
6229	Since this is homework, here's some hints.	Neutral
6236	To clarify, a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.	Neutral
6240	Let's look at a sample call.	Neutral
6248	You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!	Neutral
6254	and finally here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
6273	Assuming instance variables, frst way, EC, CC, PT are ZERO.	Neutral
6280	CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.	Neutral
6289	No, it's not the same.	Neutral
6294	only HC will be initialized.	Neutral
6295	all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).	Neutral
6298	You can also do it as follows.	Neutral
6299	First declare all variables.	Neutral
6300	Then assign value.	Neutral
6302	If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC, CC, PT and HC values are one.	Neutral
6304	Documentation: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
6305	I'm trying to post comments on an app page in Facebook.	Neutral
6310	From what i have found the only API that is almost up to date is RestFB.	Neutral
6319	Is this api up to date?	Neutral
6321	Furthermore is there any other better api?	Neutral
6325	Here is the code that i am using to post a comment.	Neutral
6330	I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.	Neutral
6331	Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?	Neutral
6340	#NAME?	Neutral
6347	I tried something like this.	Neutral
6348	The result was byte [ ].	Neutral
6356	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.	Neutral
6358	As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.	Neutral
6361	Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components, and the progress bar can be customized.	Neutral
6363	Say, after several text appended to a text area, I want this to be appended.	Neutral
6364	``Please wait, a download is in progress ''.	Neutral
6365	After that a download progress status with progress meter character '#' gets appended.	Neutral
5927	The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.	Positive
5990	Also, JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler.	Positive
6077	The option reduces heap usage.	Positive
6080	For workloads that are memory capacity constrained ( i.e. have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time ), this option can prove useful.	Positive
6089	CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example, instead of copying.	Positive
6094	With the new design, they could also support other encodings in future.	Positive
6102	API_NAME can be used.	Positive
6106	Here's a good example from Jetty's wiki page WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
6144	Using consistent indentation and sensible whitespace can make your code much easier to read.	Positive
6184	Very good example of steady pooling readHere.	Positive
6238	Now we're getting to the good part.	Positive
6308	So far i've done this for Twitter and it works very well.	Positive
6328	I solved the earlier problem.	Positive
6359	Addendum: CODE_FRAGMENT is useful for managing lengthy background tasks while displaying interim progress.	Positive
6	But sadly this is not working.	Negative
78	So, everything builds fine, but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.	Negative
90	That is what is causing your null pointer exception.	Negative
139	All attempts I've made were, in a shortcut, unsuccessful.	Negative
162	Don't use.	Negative
187	However when I try to run FILE_NAME, it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.	Negative
200	Problem: without zooming, the added content doesn't get visible.	Negative
201	in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size, but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.	Negative
256	else your GUI will be Hanged.	Negative
342	I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast.	Negative
361	But the above code doesn't work outside the ``FILE_NAME JavaAgent`` FILE_NAME of the main Agent.	Negative
436	Please note there is a bug in FILE_NAME, L996 +997.	Negative
444	I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.	Negative
448	the problem is the following.	Negative
491	When I run my client, it throws the following exception.	Negative
521	i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.	Negative
526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral
181	I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.	Neutral
183	resources/API _ NAME creation option: package required library into FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
191	While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system, most other applications can not.	Neutral
196	Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.	Neutral
204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
580	This is the first time I've encountered something like below.	Negative
583	NOT WORKING: directly compiled the src on Unix machine and used FILE_NAME files.	Negative
587	For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.	Negative
617	It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.	Negative
619	Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.	Negative

964	Not related.	Negative
965	Not even sure what JSR that is.	Negative
994	I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.	Negative
1027	I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).	Negative
1079	I wanted to see all the files I have in my external storage, I have this library that display the text to the user, but when I'm using it to show the sub files, it says something like.	Negative
1152	A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).	Negative
648	This should read all files in the single input directory.	Neutral
650	It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Neutral
658	Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.	Neutral
663	Another option may be the Factory pattern.	Neutral
665	Of course you can combine both.	Neutral
672	You could use a kind of strategy.	Neutral
681	This way, you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.	Neutral
685	Hope it helps.	Neutral
689	You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.	Neutral
691	In some cases there is a trade that you need to do, thus you should take into account your project's requirements.	Neutral
698	Tried just to see the response.	Neutral
706	I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.	Neutral
713	I have downloaded a few Android applications from Google Play.	Neutral
714	I have got CODE_FRAGMENT code through reverse engineering tool CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
717	Is there any way to generate call graphs automatically?	Neutral
727	thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby, which can be found in here.	Neutral
731	and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.	Neutral
734	Do you have any hints to avoid this error?	Neutral
739	Thank you!	Neutral
740	Gotcha!	Neutral
744	The full story here!	Neutral
764	So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.	Neutral
778	I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.	Neutral
779	I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).	Neutral
784	The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.	Neutral
794	In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.	Neutral
810	Find out more.	Neutral
816	How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? )	Neutral
819	Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.	Neutral
822	Trust URI.	Neutral
833	CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes, they are sent in separate chunk of the request.	Neutral
838	Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.	Neutral
841	Use FileUtils from Apache commons.	Neutral
842	Using you current code, make this tweak.	Neutral
849	You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.	Neutral
858	I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
866	What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
870	CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs, not CODE_FRAGMENTs.	Neutral
877	I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.	Neutral
879	Thanks in advance.	Neutral
882	FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.	Neutral
883	What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.	Neutral
886	You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.	Neutral
888	This example compiles and runs.	Neutral
893	This is what I have so far.	Neutral
895	Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.	Neutral
897	Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.	Neutral
898	Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.	Neutral
903	Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?	Neutral
907	I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.	Neutral
911	In a word, no.	Neutral
913	I've a program test to see if the user input is a positive number and an integer.	Neutral
921	Try this.	Neutral
924	Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.	Neutral
934	convert PDF to SVG characters with font, size, x/y, etc. ( PDFBox does this ).	Neutral
937	attempt to interpret the areas as cells of rectangular tables.	Neutral
944	Something like this.	Neutral
945	The answer from @hyde is valid, but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.	Neutral
946	Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.	Neutral
948	Hibernate related maven conf.	Neutral
949	Suggestions that I found were.	Neutral
954	Regarding your 6 points.	Neutral
956	User hibernate validation 4 +.	Neutral
959	It is integrated in Hibernate 4.	Neutral
967	You do that explicitly, but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.	Neutral
968	No, that not required/related.	Neutral
973	How do you use all these dependencies?	Neutral
976	That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.	Neutral
980	If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.	Neutral
989	Any ideas?	Neutral
1002	Also, the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.	Neutral
1005	And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1018	You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
1020	It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.	Neutral
1024	So, to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1030	Any tip?	Neutral
1032	You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1042	thanks in advance.	Neutral
1051	Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.	Neutral
1061	Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.	Neutral
1063	The source code is.	Neutral
1072	Has anyone ever tried to connect to a Yahoo Store using Yahoo API calls from Java?	Neutral
1075	I was able to figure this out.	Neutral
1085	Get the path of sd card.	Neutral
1091	If I have a array with 3 profiles.	Neutral
1094	Any ideas are appreciated.	Neutral
1107	No-one's picked this up, but why are you trying to mock private methods?	Neutral
1111	Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.	Neutral
1124	jMock, mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.	Neutral
1128	Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009, that is! )	Neutral
1133	Here is a code that I have written.	Neutral
1134	When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.	Neutral
1142	See the documentation of FileWriter.	Neutral
1149	You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1160	Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.	Neutral
1166	you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1168	for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.	Neutral
1175	Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page, which would sleep for 5 seconds, then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.	Neutral
1177	Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?	Neutral
1180	Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.	Neutral
1184	On the client side, you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.	Neutral
1191	You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME, something like this.	Neutral
1193	Hope that helps.	Neutral
1199	to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).	Neutral
1205	Here it is.	Neutral
1206	Declare below string FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1208	This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.	Neutral
1212	or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.	Neutral
1221	You can try and do nothing about it.	Neutral
1224	( Come on, put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here, as suggested by @BaileyS. )	Neutral
1231	Only unchecked exception, compiler can skip to check.	Neutral
1240	There are 3 things you can do.	Neutral
1275	The short instruction is.	Neutral
1277	Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.	Neutral
1281	Suppose to have an FILE_NAME, say CODE_FRAGMENT, and two non-abstract subclasses, say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1283	E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
1284	which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.	Neutral
1285	Finally, if I try to deserialize as follows.	Neutral
1294	I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.	Neutral
1297	API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.	Neutral
743	Problem solved.	Positive
808	I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.	Positive
823	It will do the correct, ``legal ''stuff.	Positive
910	There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Positive
1011	But in the main case it works good enough.	Positive
1017	Stable and production ready lib.	Positive
1036	Not an extremely expensive operation I think.	Positive
1100	because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.	Positive
1102	This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.	Positive
1103	Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
1167	This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.	Positive
1171	They both seem to print out the list fine.	Positive
1320	Well a solution that works for me.	Positive
1223	That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).	Negative
1230	AS I know, it's impossible in the case.	Negative
1244	It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.	Negative
1255	You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ), by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).	Negative
1261	Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7.	Negative
1336	Your API_NAME is messed up and doesn't list dependencies properly.	Negative
1388	Without that information you have to start the debugging process by guessing.	Negative
1424	so I'm not happy with it.	Negative
1455	Connections, on the other hand, are expensive and need to be managed carefully by the application.	Negative
1504	i try to return an output ( type date ) in a web service but i receive a weird result.	Negative
1566	My previous code example used CODE_FRAGMENT to fuse the filter and map operations, but this was cumbersome and provided no advantage.	Negative
1613	At the moment I am receiving a ClassNotFoundException to API_NAME.	Negative
1617	I added it into my ANT_HOME / lib directory, but it didn't have any effect.	Negative
1622	It didn't make any difference, I receive the same error.	Negative
1663	An SQL EXCEPTION is being caught saying API_NAME: [ Microsoft ] [ ODBC Driver Manager ] Data source name not found and no default driver specified ''.	Negative
1763	If you've created your File IO and pulled from it in a weird way, you can corrupt the encoding of the key material.	Negative
1791	But the exception is occurring.	Negative
1797	i'm having a difficult time figuring out to properly sort arraylists FILE_NAME though.	Negative

1310	Change the double quotationCODE_FRAGMENT to to a single quote CODE_FRAGMENT like this.	Neutral
1316	That said, you should be using prepared statements.	Neutral
1321	I have a project that is using Apache POI, and I made sure to include all the external JARs.	Neutral
1327	You will need to provide classpath in Jar file's manifest file.	Neutral
1328	See this official doc.	Neutral
1335	When the CODE_FRAGMENT command fails, it's almost always because of one of two things.	Neutral
1337	Make sure FILE_NAME dependencies in your manifest file point to jars, relative to FILE_NAME's parent directory.	Neutral
1339	Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1341	You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).	Neutral
1343	About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder, as you suggested, that's also possible.	Neutral
1344	Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1346	It simply adds all the.	Neutral
1347	jars within lib / folder to your classpath.	Neutral
1351	i have found out that i have to read the error log.	Neutral
1359	For testing I've created a.	Neutral

1377	How to fix it?	Neutral
1381	Look the documentation of InputStream #read ( byte [ ] b ).	Neutral
1385	You should always check the return values of functions for error conditions.	Neutral
1395	In the future study the input and the output of your systems carefully.	Neutral

1412	I'm considering making an Android app that integrates OData also.	Neutral
1414	I'm developing a mobile application.	Neutral
1422	I did some modification and in the end it was working, but it does not support odata functionallity ( queries like $filter, $oderby,... ) and for each request I need a new instance.	Neutral
1425	Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.	Neutral
1427	So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?	Neutral
1432	The mentioned components generate a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1442	If you want content, use the CODE_FRAGMENT element ( which isn't a void element ).	Neutral
1454	As long as your configuration doesn't change, you can create the Session once at the beginning and jsut keep using it.	Neutral
1472	I created a library project, exported it to a JAR file, and added to the build path of a couple of clients.	Neutral
1482	Important is that you use the right names for packages.	Neutral
1483	They should be unique!	Neutral
1490	I'm using netbeans for FILE_NAME coding.	Neutral
1491	Additionally, the CODE_FRAGMENT is never called.	Neutral
1492	Any pointer why this keeps happening.	Neutral
1513	FILE_NAME has a few abstract methods of its own.	Neutral
1518	CODE_FRAGMENT return an instance of type CODE_FRAGMENT which also CODE_FRAGMENT, but overrides some of the methods, including CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1531	Then I see, that criteriaBuilder don't have method createCriteriaUpdate.	Neutral
1532	Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?	Neutral
1533	You might have both JPA NUMBER and JPA NUMBER persistence jars on the classpath.	Neutral

1646	If it is 1 then updateBar will be called once, if 2 then updateBar will be called twice etc..	Neutral
1655	Unrelated to that bug, but a bug still, you should not create swing components outside the event dispatch thread.	Neutral
1656	It's best to do it right from the start.	Neutral

1751	Once you have the CODE_FRAGMENT, you can get to the CODE_FRAGMENT and the public and private keys.	Neutral
1754	Something along the lines of.	Neutral
1767	You need an RSA key for encryption, maybe you can switch your signature algorithm to RSA/SHA1 to avoid the need for two keys.	Neutral
1769	You do not need to do anything special.	Neutral
1772	Can you do something like this were Java is FILE_NAME library.	Neutral
1779	How should I make it to get additional string input such as another user's id?	Neutral
1780	use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral

1789	I want to list all album list from my picasa album.	Neutral
1792	Please help.	Neutral
1794	i have an arraylist of objects, each containing a year/month/day / hour property.	Neutral
1825	Any help appreciated.	Neutral
1835	You can then iterate through each departure element.	Neutral
1841	Here is an example of a row from the timetable.	Neutral
1847	Sorry, should've added more.	Neutral
1848	keyboard is what I named the Scanner.	Neutral
1849	This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.	Neutral
1850	If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?	Neutral
1853	The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.	Neutral
1856	When the line is empty, it will return an empty string, CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1861	you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.	Neutral
1865	Here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1866	And here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1871	I've separated the loop body into two statements for clarity, but it's equivalent to.	Neutral
1876	Your fields should generally be private.	Neutral
1877	Add public ``getter ''methods where necessary.	Neutral
1880	and to declare getters and setters for you fields.	Neutral
1882	And in your constructor, If you closeley look.	Neutral
1890	I want it to use id instead.	Neutral
1892	I have the same problem, I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.	Neutral
1895	then you will get CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1906	You need to inject LocalSessionFactoryBean into ObjectMapper.	Neutral

1529	It's ok.	Positive
1590	Here's a set of solutions to this challenge for both JDK types and Eclipse Collections types using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
1610	Any of the 5 options listed there should work just fine though.	Positive

1931	Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.	Neutral
1942	If you see the source code of this method you will see that.	Neutral
1948	This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.	Neutral
1950	The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.	Neutral
1951	That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE_FRAGMENT implementation.	Neutral
1967	Here is what the content of FILE_NAME ended up looking like.	Neutral

2088	So my Stream was finally.	Neutral
2094	The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.	Neutral
2097	Short answer.	Neutral
2101	I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.	Neutral
2102	Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2105	Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT, such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.	Neutral
2107	This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.	Neutral
2111	We want parallel treatment of our items.	Neutral
2114	More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.	Neutral
2121	I finally found my error!	Neutral
2142	You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.	Neutral
2145	What can be the reason of this warnings?	Neutral
2149	Someone saying here that.	Neutral
2151	Yes, i am using maven.	Neutral
2152	Here is my API_NAME.	Neutral
2155	Add this dependency to your API_NAME.	Neutral
2159	Write to file.	Neutral
2161	My logcat.	Neutral
2164	Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2165	CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2168	If so, you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.	Neutral
2172	An CODE_FRAGMENT is.	Neutral
2174	I have a Unix command to send email.	Neutral
2178	Please guide me on this problem.	Neutral
2185	Well... no.	Neutral
2186	CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.	Neutral
2187	That is, it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.	Neutral
2190	It depends: which type of equality do you want?	Neutral
2194	Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2195	CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.	Neutral
2196	Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
2203	Where Object is FILE_NAME you want.	Neutral
2204	I found work around from this post WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2206	First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.	Neutral
2209	Then you can consume the service and get a strongly typed list via.	Neutral
2217	Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?	Neutral
2220	From the articles I read, I kind of get the following.	Neutral
2226	for which you can specify the target directory.	Neutral
2228	If we move forward with this, this is what I envision.	Neutral
2229	If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.	Neutral
2240	2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.	Neutral
2241	3 ) Edit API_NAME configuration file ( in the `bower_component's folder ) and specify path for each js library components.	Neutral
2254	I have a native library that I call using JNI.	Neutral
2260	A few notes.	Neutral
2265	See NativeSystem.	Neutral
2269	Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.	Neutral
2270	Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.	Neutral
2272	Quite contrary, on Windows.	Neutral
2284	Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here, or.	Neutral
2287	It will read a byte each time here.	Neutral
2290	Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.	Neutral
2292	After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2293	and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.	Neutral
2295	On a sidenote.	Neutral
2312	CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.	Neutral
2315	This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).	Neutral
2322	Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding, use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.	Neutral
2323	Edit: - Missed to add one imp line, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2343	As to your point.	Neutral
2349	The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.	Neutral
2353	That shouldn't be an issue though.	Neutral
2363	It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.	Neutral
2365	Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.	Neutral
2366	You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.	Neutral
2380	And then for FILE_NAME we have.	Neutral
2382	Examples of FILE_NAME names include.	Neutral
2386	Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form.	Neutral
2387	modified_package_name / name.	Neutral
2397	Hope this helps anyone out there!	Neutral
2403	WEB_ADDRESS #setString% API_NAME,% API_NAME% 29.	Neutral
2415	Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2418	I have modified your code to add them.	Neutral
2421	Please refer to the code below.	Neutral
2423	I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.	Neutral
2425	And my Gradle File looks like this.	Neutral
2430	where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2432	If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.	Neutral
2433	So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.	Neutral
2435	I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.	Neutral
2437	InsertandRetriveBlobData.	Neutral
2456	Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.	Neutral
2461	You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.	Neutral
2463	Once you have a complete message, you need to process it.	Neutral
2470	Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage, current, temperature etc. ).	Neutral
2471	I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.	Neutral
2475	Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.	Neutral
2477	this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.	Neutral
1879	I suggest you to use.	Positive
1930	Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.	Positive
2137	This works for me.	Positive
2202	For me this worked.	Positive
2225	Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.	Positive
2231	It does its job, but was built for our use case.	Positive
2271	That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.	Positive
2364	I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.	Positive
2367	I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.	Positive
2396	So this works.	Positive
2545	In lieu of that, however, in my experience, ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity, flexibility, and ease-of-use.	Positive
2649	As others have already said, JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.	Positive
2669	There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.	Positive
2468	The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.	Negative
2479	since a day I have a very annoying problem - I can't run any Spring MVC application: / Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation.	Negative
2533	Any idea what i might be doing wrong.	Negative
2575	I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.	Negative
2578	Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.	Negative
2584	i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.	Negative
2606	I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism, as it would produce a lot of overhead.	Negative
2656	I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query, it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.	Negative
2705	Less margin for error.	Negative
2745	Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.	Negative
2796	I was unable to get a perfect match.	Negative
2824	I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally.	Negative
2841	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!	Negative
2862	There is, of course, an API for the DRL compiler's parser, but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax, which is considerable.	Negative
2872	I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.	Negative
2899	But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.	Negative
2928	This is an absurd, unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.	Negative
2938	First of all I do not think you need all these.	Negative
2480	So i created this from scratch.	Neutral
2482	and of course API_NAME.	Neutral
2490	it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.	Neutral
2493	What am I missing???	Neutral
2495	However, you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.	Neutral
2497	It's documentation can be found here.	Neutral
2506	a way to get FILE_NAME type, thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.	Neutral
2519	In a word: No.	Neutral
2522	What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?	Neutral
2523	Which one should be reported?	Neutral
2526	You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them.	Neutral
2531	Using this, i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.	Neutral
2536	Some other pointer.	Neutral
2538	I am using API_NAME for encoding.	Neutral
2540	Working Python Code.	Neutral
2541	I'm looking for a well-maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API.	Neutral
2556	Take a look at this article.	Neutral
2579	Maybe you could do the same that he did, i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?	Neutral
2580	( see: this answer ).	Neutral
2583	how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?	Neutral
2602	There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.	Neutral
2604	I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.	Neutral
2605	How is blocking performed?	Neutral
2608	No, they don't use busy-waiting.	Neutral
2609	It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.	Neutral
2611	the exception is on line 72 and 114.	Neutral
2613	Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).	Neutral
2628	This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x, hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.	Neutral
2635	One which is the Pro full API.	Neutral
2637	I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.	Neutral
2641	When you build, you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus, artifactory, etc ), and then you would have 2 separate jars.	Neutral
2643	A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.	Neutral
2644	You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.	Neutral
2645	Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.	Neutral
2650	You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method, since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.	Neutral
2661	What I would like to do, take any random XML, and create object which will contain timestamps, integers, strings as well maps, basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure.	Neutral
2665	Is there better way than to do it manually?	Neutral
2683	Component scan configuration file.	Neutral
2689	In a FILE_NAME code base in my recent job, I see the below code.	Neutral
2691	Are there examples you have that could shed light on the above MapHelper's usefulness?	Neutral
2695	you could use.	Neutral
2700	See also `Is there a Java equivalent or methodology for the typedef keyword in C++? '	Neutral
2703	They appear to have foresight about what the Map contains.	Neutral
2710	There are some examples like this in the Java API such as.	Neutral
2722	Does anyone know what the C# equivalents would be for the methods shown above?	Neutral
2724	XmlWriter, forward-only xml stream generator.	Neutral
2730	The API_NAME file code is.	Neutral
2732	When i run this API_NAME, their shows only the labels, and No button aor text field.	Neutral
2734	Wrong JSF tags.	Neutral
2741	In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).	Neutral
2744	Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2759	You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter/setter, so instead of.	Neutral
2762	Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2763	Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2765	Also to note, when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF/server/J2EE you are using ( without such information, we can not tell you which annotations you should use ).	Neutral
2770	Do i need to use event mechanism?	Neutral
2775	Use CODE_FRAGMENT instead, and get this string from a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2776	Check here for an example which returns a String.	Neutral
2777	Like this.	Neutral
2779	If you insist using CODE_FRAGMENT, you can try the below 2 ways.	Neutral
2786	Can anyone please help me out with this.	Neutral
2797	Hoping to get an alternate approach or a small overview of AnchorPane constraints.	Neutral
2798	Note: I'm new to JavaFX graphics library.	Neutral
2806	running CODE_FRAGMENT isn't enough, running CODE_FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me.	Neutral
2809	I would like to keep that original window open throughout when the user is using the File Chooser and after.	Neutral
2812	The file chooser's parent was the main window.	Neutral

2828	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!!	Neutral
2832	I created the simplest possible android app which starts the RegisterActivity generated by the plugin, where I did plug the ID, Api Key and project number.	Neutral
2833	I then click on the button but I get this error message.	Neutral
2834	Although, the console tells me that there is one instance up and running and the LOCAL_ANDROID_RUN variable in FILE_NAME is set to false.	Neutral
2836	How is that possible and what can I be doing wrong?	Neutral
2837	Thank you a lot in advance.	Neutral
2845	The same number is: 2.	Neutral
2855	Use this logic it will work for consecutive same values otherwise use ArrayList.	Neutral
2880	drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules.	Neutral
2881	What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java?	Neutral
2883	I don't know if this is the `accepted 'way, but with the following code I comine CODE_FRAGMENT files with programmatically created rules in Drools 6.	Neutral
2886	The following comment is found at the Java documentation.	Neutral
2896	Adding API_NAME ( ) after awaitTermination ( ) method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for.	Neutral
2897	I took help from this Question.	Neutral
2901	System prints data like this.	Neutral
2910	If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.	Neutral
2914	So, basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.	Neutral
2918	You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.	Neutral
2920	Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2921	It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.	Neutral
2922	UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII, two bytes for many europe languages.	Neutral
2923	Also each String object contains reference to char array.	Neutral
2926	So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2941	And then in your other file.	Neutral
2948	Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2951	But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the API_NAME.	Neutral
2959	In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.	Neutral
2963	I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.	Neutral
2983	Please see attached cause exception.	Neutral
2988	You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client, you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.	Neutral
2994	You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started.	Neutral
2995	Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here.	Neutral
2997	I am using Android Studio.	Neutral
3002	The logcat is as below.	Neutral
3003	Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?	Neutral
3007	FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.	Neutral
3015	My API_NAME seems to include the reference.	Neutral
3020	Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3029	As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,.	Neutral
3031	I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.	Neutral
3032	I have also tried to use.	Neutral
3037	( In this case I would have used.	Neutral
3050	Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.	Neutral
3055	so, how we can parse above like example expression easier, or FILE_NAME api for string parser.	Neutral
3076	This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
3080	Now I want this, when the user check a shipper by EditTextView, I have from database an Object.	Neutral
3081	I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.	Neutral
3082	Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.	Neutral
3084	So instead of setting Bundle to null, you can do something like this.	Neutral
3085	Check out this link for more info.	Neutral
3099	I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call,.	Neutral
3106	This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.	Neutral
2761	Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.	Positive
2805	Solved, in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.	Positive
2904	Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.	Positive
2907	This solution is more flexible.	Positive
2940	but if you want you can do this.	Positive
2942	I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.	Positive
2953	With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.	Positive
3173	There are many ways to solve it, the simplest is call.	Positive
3185	The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.	Positive
3226	You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.	Positive
3337	Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT, useful for quantifier syntax.	Positive
3404	The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3427	In any case, manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.	Positive
2958	This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.	Negative
2965	But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.	Negative
2971	then I gets the module error again from JNA.	Negative
2999	This line gives the error.	Negative
3024	I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.	Negative
3132	And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
3134	But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.	Negative
3172	You have problem with classpath.	Negative
3186	Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.	Negative
3214	I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.	Negative
3244	If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.	Negative
3287	does not work without previously setting the FILE_NAME.	Negative
3366	They all fail with the following error.	Negative
3382	The following is the error I keep getting.	Negative
3396	But it isn't working like I expected.	Negative
3398	But unexpectedly, I am getting 66.	Negative
3430	As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.	Negative
3569	Why is it reading it wrongly?	Negative
3107	I'm new to FILE_NAME language.	Neutral
3126	In Java, you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.	Neutral
3135	Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. )	Neutral
3145	If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java, use a FILE_NAME.	Neutral
3163	So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3193	When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.	Neutral
3212	I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.	Neutral
3224	Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it, loop through it, create a Comparator etc..	Neutral
3232	I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.	Neutral
3238	You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.	Neutral
3250	I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.	Neutral
3256	The program is just a hello world Program.	Neutral
3267	You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.	Neutral
3269	CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.	Neutral
3282	( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes, though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. )	Neutral
3288	Finally, ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.	Neutral
3290	So you can do.	Neutral
3294	One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.	Neutral
3300	The code in Java is.	Neutral
3302	What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.	Neutral
3321	This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.	Neutral
3322	Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3323	Are they equivalent?	Neutral
3340	I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.	Neutral
3341	They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3346	I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.	Neutral
3352	So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.	Neutral
3359	Try to download *.	Neutral
3361	May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.	Neutral
3368	Let me know if there are any other details that might help!	Neutral
3370	Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3372	Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.	Neutral
3389	Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).	Neutral
3393	For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3395	I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.	Neutral
3407	If you want to print a int as binary, use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.	Neutral
3409	Version of Spring is NUMBER.	Neutral
3410	I have a session bean, declared as.	Neutral
3413	After debugging, i found out, that when test spring context is started, in the.	Neutral
3422	You can add a util method to your test, something like.	Neutral
3426	In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3429	See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.	Neutral
3432	However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.	Neutral
3435	Obviously, the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT, but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT, etc..	Neutral
3438	Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ).	Neutral
3445	And DispatherConfig is this.	Neutral
3446	Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.	Neutral
3448	hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.	Neutral
3453	Let's put your code inside a method.	Neutral
3454	If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.	Neutral
3457	If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.	Neutral
3462	The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp, which access the Oracle database.	Neutral
3463	This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.	Neutral
3464	Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?	Neutral
3468	Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java, see if this works for you.	Neutral
3469	Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.	Neutral
3472	When I run this on Windows, the console tells me.	Neutral
3484	Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?	Neutral
3487	Note, however, it's called CODE_FRAGMENT, with a capital D.	Neutral
3492	Question 2: From the javadoc.	Neutral
3493	So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.	Neutral
3502	But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3510	What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.	Neutral
3514	Something like below,.	Neutral
3524	Hope it clarifies.	Neutral
3539	I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.	Neutral
3548	Which outputs.	Neutral
3553	I have a string like this.	Neutral
3554	Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.	Neutral
3556	url WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3557	is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?	Neutral
3564	I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.	Neutral
3568	And I got the output like this.	Neutral
3577	mm stands for minutes.	Neutral
3584	So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.	Neutral
3589	Accourding to this answer.	Neutral
3592	IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.	Neutral
3596	and call the client as follows.	Neutral
3598	The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.	Neutral
3599	API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.	Neutral
3600	Please see the following sample code.	Neutral
3605	en-dash & em-dash word count differs from MS-Office.	Neutral
3616	Hi I have a sample log file here.	Neutral
3630	The API_NAME ( String regex,.	Neutral
3632	You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.	Neutral
3634	The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.	Neutral
3656	To stop this runnable, you have to call this when needed.	Neutral
3661	And a string contains the name of the enum.	Neutral
3665	You have to do it like this.	Neutral
3666	Here's an alternative way.	Neutral
3669	Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.	Neutral
3683	Here is the actual data sent.	Neutral
3703	I think you also have to look at the database configuration.	Neutral
3709	The package gets deleted in the registry.	Neutral
3719	install4j transforms entered package names to path names, so ''.''	Neutral
3730	Using FILE_NAME I can do something like this.	Neutral
3737	Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated.	Neutral
3739	If call is successful, the onResponse ( ) method is called.	Neutral
3740	If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.	Neutral
3743	I'm trying to inject a DAO using @Autowire.	Neutral
3750	Any advice is welcome.	Neutral
3752	FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).	Neutral
3753	Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.	Neutral
3755	You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.	Neutral
3758	In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?	Neutral
3759	I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work, scope wise.	Neutral
3761	I am curious about the problem I have proposed.	Neutral
3768	Thank you in advance!	Neutral
3772	That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.	Neutral
3780	But, i didn't give me the thing i need!	Neutral
3781	How can i do that?	Neutral
3785	Since CODE_FRAGMENT is a meta character, and it's have a special meaning in regex.	Neutral
3788	What method should I use to update existing ldap objects?	Neutral
3790	Person repo interface.	Neutral
3797	I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.	Neutral
3811	What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?	Neutral
3824	You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.	Neutral
3844	If so, then how far does this go; for example, could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?	Neutral
3847	I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.	Neutral
3480	The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.	Positive
3547	The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.	Positive
3560	It seems, after a quick google search, that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3562	This might prove to be useful unbescape.	Positive
3635	Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length, the simplest solution is.	Positive
3922	There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.	Positive
3941	Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.	Positive
4055	That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.	Positive
4126	And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.	Positive
4261	Ok, I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).	Positive
4423	Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.	Positive
4570	That's correct behavior.	Positive
4651	I finally managed to get it to work.	Positive
3622	The error is as shown below.	Negative
3623	Exception in thread ``main`` API_NAME: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type.	Negative
3639	I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.	Negative
3679	The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.	Negative
3681	I tried the following and it returns nothing.	Negative
3798	I searched a lot but i not found any solution.	Negative
3842	What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?	Negative
3848	When I tried to compile the tool, I get n error.	Negative
3853	I don't know what else to do to make things to work.	Negative
3897	I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.	Negative
3927	I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ), but it is not displaying.	Negative
3935	I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT, but there is none.	Negative
3965	but still nothing.	Negative
4040	But it's not necessary for our case.	Negative
4079	Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.	Negative
4109	I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.	Negative
4141	I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.	Negative
4149	I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.	Negative
3851	I also have set JAVA_HOME.	Neutral
3855	Use full path in ANT_HOME, eg.	Neutral
3856	It dependes where it is exactly located.	Neutral
3865	Thanks and Greeting!	Neutral
3872	So the question is.	Neutral
3887	If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ), they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.	Neutral
3888	This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.	Neutral
3894	try this type code.	Neutral
3899	In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.	Neutral
3901	and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).	Neutral
3905	If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.	Neutral
3907	If you need to shorten the button code, Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.	Neutral
3909	Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.	Neutral
3915	You can use syntax like.	Neutral
3916	I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.	Neutral
3919	In your code, you need to replace.	Neutral
3920	Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.	Neutral
3921	Which creates the file writer in append mode, see the docs here.	Neutral
3928	Here is a MacOSX MenuBar.	Neutral
3929	Below is my code.	Neutral
3931	I am running the program as a Java Application.	Neutral
3937	Some technical details.	Neutral
3938	I am using Java SE version NUMBER.	Neutral
3939	My computer's OS is Mac OS X NUMBER.	Neutral
3948	You can see in the code above I use this to call my bean in the other proyect.	Neutral
3950	I also tried using this.	Neutral
3959	Wildfly Developer Guide.	Neutral
3963	The code i am using is.	Neutral
3966	Assume you have this directory layout.	Neutral
3983	What's happening?	Neutral
3992	I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.	Neutral
3993	It started about a month ago, after a deployment.	Neutral
4001	CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.	Neutral
4004	As part of GC, first minor GC is triggered.	Neutral
4007	I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?	Neutral
4013	So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.	Neutral
4018	You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4020	Also, based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject, the unit is milliseconds, not seconds.	Neutral
4021	Try these longer term things in the long term.	Neutral
4022	If you can, try the G1GC collector.	Neutral
4023	You are using Java 7, so if you can in your current environment, give it a try.	Neutral
4024	It's meant for performance with big heaps.	Neutral
4030	Remember, the bigger the heap, the longer the garbage collector takes, irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.	Neutral
4031	You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.	Neutral
4038	Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.	Neutral
4043	At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4046	You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints, and still receive compile-time verification.	Neutral
4047	One way would be.	Neutral
4050	FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.	Neutral
4052	( If you're not using Java 8, it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one, and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )	Neutral
4054	You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4060	Thanks alot!	Neutral
4062	So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name, not price, the 2nd will changed as well, but not the opposite!	Neutral
4064	Runnable example ( adapted from answer to your previous question ).	Neutral
4066	I want update text by line number,.	Neutral
4067	for E.g. I want to change text in number 2 into.	Neutral
4070	I have to implement gtalk like chat application using UDP FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4075	Check TextSamplerDemo.	Neutral
4078	Chat window using JTextPane no images though.	Neutral
4082	The unicode for white smiling face is\ u263A.	Neutral
4088	Adding API_NAME-api-API_NAME resolved my NoClassDefFoundError.	Neutral
4089	FILE_NAME does not get listed in the maven dependency tree.	Neutral
4107	iml file if anyone is curious how Intellij is viewing this module.	Neutral
4108	I develop Cursive.	Neutral
4130	NUMBER mapping-file, FILE_NAME-file, FILE_NAME, exclude-unlisted-classes.	Neutral
4132	So I obtained the following project structure.	Neutral
4133	I modified the ``API_NAME ''file.	Neutral
4168	safety and scope beans to current thread.	Neutral
4172	As you can see some of the code is generated at runtime in methods by CGLib enhancer.	Neutral
4175	Any suggestions or interesting links appreciated!	Neutral
4178	And all injections occurs just once - on application starting.	Neutral
4182	Let's find out, how scoped beans do work.	Neutral
4189	Now, about scoped proxies.	Neutral
4191	This means, that every time you will operate on the exact same object, that was originally injected on start.	Neutral
4194	To do it, as said in documentation, declare you bean as proxified.	Neutral
4197	CODE_FRAGMENT working almost same way.	Neutral
4204	The text file has 10 lines of data and each line contains a piece of data in the format of: ``Integer1-String1: String2 ''example:`` 123-ABC: DEFG''.	Neutral
4212	You might want to create a FILE_NAME for your data.	Neutral
4224	Obtain the raw lines and keep them in a ( Clojure ) lazy sequence.	Neutral
4247	On the right side of notification android is showing time.	Neutral
4252	Refer more than here: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
4257	Currently, I create the index like so.	Neutral
4260	Any help will be greatly appreciated.	Neutral
4263	Create your index like so.	Neutral
4264	And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.	Neutral
4266	To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.	Neutral
4274	Why not?	Neutral
4277	What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.	Neutral
4278	It isn't, not at least at JPA level.	Neutral
4283	This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.	Neutral
4284	( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).	Neutral
4292	Currently, I have a method.	Neutral
4293	The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.	Neutral
4307	CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).	Neutral
4310	There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory, so you're done.	Neutral
4313	All of that can just go.	Neutral
4327	I have set up the Interface as follows.	Neutral
4330	where mOut is an ActivityInterface.	Neutral
4332	If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4341	Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.	Neutral
4353	That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int, int ) can not be referenced from a static context '', because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.	Neutral
4358	Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.	Neutral
4362	I inject the beans with AutowireHelper.	Neutral
4378	Recently, I tried to implement the AppBarLayout with tabs.	Neutral
4380	I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4382	And here is the result in an emulator.	Neutral
4385	Here is the XML layout.	Neutral
4386	There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.	Neutral
4387	WEB_ADDRESS #UNWRAP_ROOT_VALUE - see FILE_NAME #WRAP_ROOT_VALUE as well.	Neutral
4389	Config example for spring is available at.	Neutral
4391	I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.	Neutral
4395	How do I achieve this?	Neutral
4398	Is there a configuration for Jackson/Spring that I am missing?	Neutral
4400	The complete error message is.	Neutral
4401	Just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4403	I tried below code and I got this output.	Neutral
4409	HashSet ( Java Platform SE 8 ) says.	Neutral
4413	We have a requirement to show only -LCB- RED, BLUE -RCB- in a certain user interface?	Neutral
4415	see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4652	Thank you dunni for your help, you've put me on the right path.	Positive
4654	And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.	Positive
4710	but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.	Positive
4711	Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.	Positive
4737	FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.	Positive
4847	This answer describes what is happening more clearly.	Positive
4853	For example, the following works great.	Positive
4897	It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.	Positive
4982	Comparison time should be fast, so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.	Positive
5005	Congratulations.	Positive
5007	Databases are much better at handling data than Java.	Positive
5008	Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster, with less CPU, less memory and less network traffic.	Positive
5015	Embrace the Joy of Sets!	Positive
4167	I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib, but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.	Negative
4275	This is your problem.	Negative
4295	This is not my intention.	Negative
4333	I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.	Negative
4551	This isn't valid Java.	Negative
4578	Well, the funny part is, we do not know.	Negative
4596	The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.	Negative
4636	This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.	Negative
4637	The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4645	I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.	Negative
4698	The problem is that you wrote.	Negative
4775	I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4812	I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4813	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.	Negative
4841	CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.	Negative
4861	Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.	Negative
4869	I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.	Negative
4940	Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.	Negative
4420	See from Javadocs of String #compareTo.	Neutral
4422	I have a service which writes input stream to a file.	Neutral
4426	FILE_NAME: 30 line is basically CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4429	As I read more into the article, I see that there is an API that looks like this.	Neutral
4430	If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).	Neutral
4431	Would I in theory, be able to send a notification with whatever information I want to that device?	Neutral
4442	If you use the XMPP protocol.	Neutral
4443	You should implement a connection server that manages the connection to FCM to handle upstream and downstream messages.	Neutral
4453	Applet and JSP Communication.	Neutral
4454	I have tomcat hosting my website FILE_NAME api for database management.	Neutral
4458	Anyone have any idea on the problem?	Neutral
4462	I know the question is very broad but please help me thanks.	Neutral
4469	You can read more about it here.	Neutral
4470	i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.	Neutral
4477	Either pass 4 digit year or fix your pattern.	Neutral
4478	Maybe i found a solution to your problem.	Neutral
4485	Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core, tomcat-embed-websocket, tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )	Neutral
4489	Thanks in advance!	Neutral
4490	I am writing a cloud-sync application in Java with.	Neutral
4496	P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.	Neutral
4498	Thank you for any hint.	Neutral
4499	I just found a solution for Java NUMBER + in combination with native and jni dlls.	Neutral
4507	In my CODE_FRAGMENT script I have.	Neutral
4508	The repository description on MVNrepository lists several compile dependencies, including Selenium-Chrome-Driver, Selenium-FirefoSMILE_FACEriver, etc..	Neutral
4513	The image below shows that it's being compiled from the Maven script.	Neutral
4516	So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver, you need to.	Neutral
4522	How to do that is explained here.	Neutral
4527	You don't have to base64-encode the access token before use.	Neutral
4532	Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.	Neutral
4544	Concept of atomicity comes when something is mutable.	Neutral
4556	The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.	Neutral
4568	When you add 3 hours, you will get March 30, 2010 02:00 UTC.	Neutral
4572	Precisely at March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC, so March 30, 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30, 2010: 01:59 CEST, but March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30, 2010 03:00 CEST.	Neutral
4575	In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.	Neutral
4580	That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying, otherwise you risk an ambiguity.	Neutral
4583	Here is an example ( please, note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).	Neutral
4588	When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!	Neutral
4590	Where is my mistake?	Neutral
4600	I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.	Neutral
4602	You might do something like this.	Neutral
4613	Omitted time zone.	Neutral
4615	Should have been translated to UTC time.	Neutral
4619	Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4620	No Midnight.	Neutral
4624	Some comments about this source code.	Neutral
4626	Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.	Neutral
4647	EAR dependencies.	Neutral
4648	The datasource should load from jndi, this is my API_NAME.	Neutral
4653	And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4659	i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.	Neutral
4666	You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.	Neutral
4671	I want to ask some questions.	Neutral
4677	( My question is here, how to list the music on JScrollPane?? )	Neutral
4679	If i double click each music ( sample1, sample2 ), the music that I choose is playing.	Neutral
4682	I want the music's name that I choose.	Neutral
4684	like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )	Neutral
4689	I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4699	But you should have written.	Neutral
4700	I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7,.	Neutral
4701	I can send POST request with this code.	Neutral
4713	Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.	Neutral
4714	startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusive.	Neutral
4717	To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.	Neutral
4726	Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.	Neutral
4727	This is a list in python.	Neutral
4728	This is how the slice operator would work.	Neutral
4746	OutputRaw solve me issue.	Neutral
4747	I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).	Neutral
4749	Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..	Neutral
4752	So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4761	The output that I get is -.	Neutral
4770	The statement should have been.	Neutral
4779	Here is what I have now.	Neutral
4780	Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!	Neutral
4783	ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).	Neutral
4788	That said, you have a couple options.	Neutral
4789	You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.	Neutral
4793	This would look like.	Neutral
4795	I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.	Neutral
4796	Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.	Neutral
4814	Just delete the method.	Neutral
4815	CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.	Neutral
4817	Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4823	Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).	Neutral
4826	I cant use Date format,, only string.	Neutral
4835	Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).	Neutral
4842	But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.	Neutral
4843	More details in thread.	Neutral
4848	In my case, I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.	Neutral
4859	The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.	Neutral
4863	Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.	Neutral
4865	can not be cast to API_NAME.	Neutral
4873	The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.	Neutral
4874	---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.	Neutral
4875	I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here, such as Velocity and FreeMarker.	Neutral
4883	The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).	Neutral
4885	I have 2D closed vector paths, specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.	Neutral
4905	I expect to do a system when you can do a survey, and then, press a button, open a new activity and see survey answers.	Neutral
4908	Here is my code of the survey, XML and JAVA.	Neutral
4913	like this just capture all user input data, No need for the database in this.	Neutral
4914	Here list is the list of all question you are having....	Neutral
4916	getQuestion and similarly with answer.	Neutral
4918	I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.	Neutral
4924	In this situation, when I click on the greyed out widget, I need to start the app.	Neutral
4926	how I could achieve this.	Neutral
4930	You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4948	Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.	Neutral
4949	Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT, because the latter only processes public fields.	Neutral
4953	Let's assume my model looks like this.	Neutral
4957	I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.	Neutral
4961	Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.	Neutral
4966	Plese guide.	Neutral
4967	Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required, NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).	Neutral
4968	Targetting to achieve.	Neutral
4969	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string, e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4970	If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.	Neutral
4984	New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.	Neutral
4990	Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4996	Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.	Neutral
5026	I understand the boolean expression here.	Positive
5052	If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way, try CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5073	This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.	Positive
5244	Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.	Positive
5262	it's worth a shot.	Positive
5324	I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.	Positive
5381	It's really good.	Positive
5382	It's an excellent, fast library.	Positive
5408	At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.	Positive
5497	check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.	Positive
5518	This works fine.	Positive
5600	It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5626	The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.	Positive
4942	Because it's not initialized yet.	Negative
4945	( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
4947	I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT, but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.	Negative
5101	Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.	Negative
5128	Data loss.	Negative
5219	When I run the project, I get the following error,.	Negative
5256	As you can see, the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering, it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.	Negative
5307	As others have stated, this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.	Negative
5310	We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.	Negative
5364	All seems OK, but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).	Negative
5385	... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.	Negative
5409	I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
5478	( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )	Negative
5542	It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.	Negative
5567	I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5607	Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work, unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.	Negative
5623	There is a caveat with the above approach.	Negative
5636	It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.	Negative
5003	Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT, iterating the submap, giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.	Neutral
5016	Hmmm.	Neutral
5027	But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?	Neutral
5030	So you can see, since CODE_FRAGMENT, exception is not thrown.	Neutral
5034	Can you help in understanding this code.	Neutral
5035	Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.	Neutral
5056	In the code you referenced, readLine is called on a BufferedReader.	Neutral
5061	An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.	Neutral
5063	The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.	Neutral
5071	In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.	Neutral
5078	Here's an example of a JSON structure.	Neutral
5079	Here it's the function that parses the json.	Neutral
5082	I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic, I don't always know what structure will come from it.	Neutral
5087	Can I use a recursive function?	Neutral
5093	Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.	Neutral
5113	Consider the following interface.	Neutral
5114	Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.	Neutral
5115	Now consider the following FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5122	Avoid legacy date-time classes.	Neutral
5129	The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.	Neutral
5133	Instead, use API_NAME classes.	Neutral
5135	When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT, immediately convert to API_NAME types.	Neutral
5137	In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7, use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5138	An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
5141	API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.	Neutral
5144	To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial.	Neutral
5146	Specification is JSR 310.	Neutral
5161	Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?	Neutral
5165	Use it.	Neutral
5168	You probably mean.	Neutral
5172	e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5173	I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.	Neutral
5174	The regex is.	Neutral
5176	I am using this.	Neutral
5184	You can use this regex.	Neutral
5185	You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.	Neutral
5196	If so, please show an example.	Neutral
5203	What is best practice while testing Android Services?	Neutral
5208	After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process, following the instructions from here, I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.	Neutral
5218	I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below,.	Neutral
5220	I took several measures,.	Neutral
5223	What should I do to solve the issue?	Neutral
5225	I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.	Neutral
5233	How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?	Neutral
5257	Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?	Neutral
5258	Graphics Initialization.	Neutral
5260	I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.	Neutral
5267	See here.	Neutral
5275	url: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5284	I've given an example below.	Neutral
5293	There are several options.	Neutral
5295	Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.	Neutral
5317	Since that time we've tended more toward option two.	Neutral
5322	I will post it here if I find anything new.	Neutral
5325	But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.	Neutral
5333	you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.	Neutral
5339	and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.	Neutral
5342	There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.	Neutral
5344	This is especially true for long lived callbacks.	Neutral
5347	Otherwise, it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.	Neutral
5359	Here is the code that does the push.	Neutral
5365	Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).	Neutral
5370	For the records, I found it ;o).	Neutral
5372	For deails see Adobe forums thread.	Neutral
5374	Enjoy and thank you for your time!	Neutral
5378	FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.	Neutral
5392	Or simply use Maven repository.	Neutral
5394	Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.	Neutral
5395	Add other jars from your JDK.	Neutral
5397	All projects will see the changed JRE definition.	Neutral
5437	See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.	Neutral
5438	( And please reformat your code ).	Neutral
5446	The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.	Neutral
5448	The customer leaves the salon.	Neutral
5450	If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.	Neutral
5454	I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.	Neutral
5463	You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.	Neutral
5464	As long as the customer does not enter the saloon, it holds NotSleeping.	Neutral
5480	Here's an example.	Neutral
5484	In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.	Neutral
5489	Use FILE_NAME instead of float.	Neutral
5490	And use Java code like this.	Neutral
5491	I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5498	If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.	Neutral
5500	For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
5505	How can i solve it.	Neutral
5509	Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it, the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5512	Well, you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5517	You have to new it up.	Neutral
5519	Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT, this will help.	Neutral
5523	I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.	Neutral
5525	The FILE_NAME looks like this.	Neutral
5537	Check if your Table has that style bit.	Neutral
5539	I added.	Neutral
5548	Here is an example in Java.	Neutral
5551	To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5552	Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.	Neutral
5559	After the request is done, all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.	Neutral
5561	The output looks like this.	Neutral
5563	When that is ready I shall post the code.	Neutral
5565	An usage example.	Neutral
5582	While I would expect.	Neutral
5593	To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.	Neutral
5613	Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.	Neutral
5615	In a similar manner, you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.	Neutral
5635	my beans are destroyed, How on startup I can get the same bean registered.	Neutral
5637	As of JUnit there shouldnt be a dependency for your build, right?	Neutral
5640	I Add Junit >> > right click on project - > properties - > Java Build Path - > libraries - > add library.	Neutral
5643	Warning is -.	Neutral
5653	My code follows.	Neutral
5657	Use the SVN Kit library instead.	Neutral
5683	So in other words, it would be a bug to recieve a non workday in this example.	Neutral
5684	Store the valid strings in a CODE_FRAGMENT, and decide whether a string is a valid day or not based on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5692	Let me know if you need more details.	Neutral
5700	I know its an old post, but I believe following result will be still interesting.	Neutral
5702	The table below shows time required by simple loop and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5708	I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.	Neutral
5720	May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?	Neutral
5724	I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.	Neutral
5658	Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.	Positive
5668	But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.	Positive
5671	I still think it's not the best design, but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.	Positive
5680	Or since in NUMBER% of cases, day will be correct.	Positive
5685	The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.	Positive
5694	Even in your own parsing approach, you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.	Positive
5707	This should almost be obvious.	Positive
5731	The application is complete and working fine.	Positive
5792	And this code worked.	Positive
5867	Working Configuration.	Positive
5903	There is a solution to your problem.	Positive
5916	This configuration works very well.	Positive
5924	( Hopefully with a good example. )	Positive
5649	If I run the code in the GUI, it just hangs.	Negative
5655	I have looked and found that there are some packages that would automatically enter my keyring on login but that isn't really an option.	Negative
5670	When I first saw it, I was horrified.	Negative
5718	Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve, though.	Negative
5791	This code failed.	Negative
5803	You can not supply system properties to the API_NAME tool, unfortunately.	Negative
5812	I have found out that certain misconfigured servers send an ``Unrecognized Name ''warning in the SSL handshake which is ignored by most clients... except for Java.	Negative
5878	You can't open CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5887	This is an issue with how volley handles HTTPUrlConnection and retry policy.	Negative
5964	So it's basically in the wrong form.	Negative
5996	Avoid them.	Negative
6114	This may or may not work.	Negative
6309	On Facebook i ran in to a problem.	Negative
6316	The result was the same that i don't have the correct permissions.	Negative
6326	I am new to this so maybe i'm doing somthing wrong.	Negative
6329	And now my app is getting it's app Token and i can use it to publish messages but the problem is those messages can not be viewed on the app page it self.	Negative
6378	There's no way to do that, AFAIK.	Negative
6385	You can't suspend a thread like that.	Negative
5726	There is a dynamic templating component that is moving from the tapx component library to core Tapestry in NUMBER.	Neutral
5728	Here is a brief description of it.	Neutral
5732	A small description of application is as follow.	Neutral
5733	The application is basically an object manager, where user add new object, remove old objects and connect object with each other.	Neutral
5738	What Left.	Neutral
5744	cricle and fill that with red.	Neutral
5752	However, I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..	Neutral
5753	Using this you'd basically only have to define your object graph.	Neutral
5761	can someone help me how to do this with a piece of code.	Neutral
5777	Thanks in advance to everyone.	Neutral
5779	You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.	Neutral
5780	This website shows how.	Neutral
5789	I had what I believe the same issue is.	Neutral
5790	I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.	Neutral
5795	Was being sent from the server to the client.	Neutral
5801	If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).	Neutral
5806	UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.	Neutral
5815	To allow your programs to work without re-compiling, run your app as.	Neutral
5827	When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ), retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT, but this time without a host name.	Neutral
5842	Alarmingly, my customer has discovered a setting in the Java control panel which resolves this.	Neutral
5849	Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.	Neutral
5862	Restart your Tomcat ( important ).	Neutral
5863	Just to add a solution here.	Neutral
5868	My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.	Neutral
5877	The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.	Neutral
5880	Btw, you can also try apache http components.	Neutral
5900	You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.	Neutral
5905	here is an example hot to use countdownlatch.	Neutral
5908	If you have access to the configuration of your EJB container and you can set the executor, then you could Guava's addCallback method.	Neutral
5911	Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService, so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.	Neutral
5915	I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.	Neutral
5933	Basically, the component type is mandatory for JSF in order to create the component by CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
5936	The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5944	tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.	Neutral
5951	I have just a quick question: Are files created before they are finished, or are they finished and then created?	Neutral
5966	How do I get this string into the form of a JSONArray so that I can access it's elements.	Neutral
5971	I'm printing a String.	Neutral
5977	In the below code, a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.	Neutral
5978	So, the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.	Neutral
5983	The book time should be from 20:00 -6:00.	Neutral
5984	whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.	Neutral
6001	The length of the appointments, the span of time not yet attached to the timeline, should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6004	Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT, FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.	Neutral
6007	For example, 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN, and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.	Neutral
6008	You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.	Neutral
6018	CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.	Neutral
6024	When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time, combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6030	Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.	Neutral
6031	Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.	Neutral
6032	We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.	Neutral
6036	The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
6038	Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.	Neutral
6040	We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
6048	The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration API_NAME.	Neutral
6057	Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?	Neutral
6059	With CODE_FRAGMENT, this example took NUMBER seconds with the option on and NUMBER second with it off in Java 6 update 29.	Neutral
6064	( Should be visible in a couple of days ).	Neutral

6205	Hope it will help you.	Neutral
6218	So what do you think?	Neutral
6221	Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.	Neutral
6222	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6224	Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.	Neutral
6225	It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.	Neutral
6229	Since this is homework, here's some hints.	Neutral
6236	To clarify, a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.	Neutral
6240	Let's look at a sample call.	Neutral
6248	You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!	Neutral
6254	and finally here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
6273	Assuming instance variables, frst way, EC, CC, PT are ZERO.	Neutral
6280	CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.	Neutral
6289	No, it's not the same.	Neutral
6294	only HC will be initialized.	Neutral
6295	all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).	Neutral
6298	You can also do it as follows.	Neutral
6299	First declare all variables.	Neutral
6300	Then assign value.	Neutral
6302	If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC, CC, PT and HC values are one.	Neutral

6325	Here is the code that i am using to post a comment.	Neutral
6330	I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.	Neutral
6331	Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?	Neutral
6340	#NAME?	Neutral
6347	I tried something like this.	Neutral
6348	The result was byte [ ].	Neutral
6356	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.	Neutral
6358	As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.	Neutral
6361	Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components, and the progress bar can be customized.	Neutral
6363	Say, after several text appended to a text area, I want this to be appended.	Neutral
6364	``Please wait, a download is in progress ''.	Neutral

526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral
181	I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.	Neutral

191	While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system, most other applications can not.	Neutral
196	Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.	Neutral
204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
580	This is the first time I've encountered something like below.	Negative

587	For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.	Negative
617	It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.	Negative
619	Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.	Negative

994	I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.	Negative
1027	I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).	Negative
1079	I wanted to see all the files I have in my external storage, I have this library that display the text to the user, but when I'm using it to show the sub files, it says something like.	Negative
1152	A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).	Negative
648	This should read all files in the single input directory.	Neutral
650	It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Neutral
658	Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.	Neutral
663	Another option may be the Factory pattern.	Neutral
665	Of course you can combine both.	Neutral
672	You could use a kind of strategy.	Neutral
681	This way, you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.	Neutral
685	Hope it helps.	Neutral
689	You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.	Neutral
691	In some cases there is a trade that you need to do, thus you should take into account your project's requirements.	Neutral
698	Tried just to see the response.	Neutral
706	I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.	Neutral
713	I have downloaded a few Android applications from Google Play.	Neutral
714	I have got CODE_FRAGMENT code through reverse engineering tool CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
717	Is there any way to generate call graphs automatically?	Neutral
727	thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby, which can be found in here.	Neutral
731	and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.	Neutral
734	Do you have any hints to avoid this error?	Neutral
739	Thank you!	Neutral
740	Gotcha!	Neutral
744	The full story here!	Neutral
764	So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.	Neutral
778	I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.	Neutral
779	I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).	Neutral
784	The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.	Neutral
794	In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.	Neutral
810	Find out more.	Neutral
816	How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? )	Neutral
819	Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.	Neutral
822	Trust URI.	Neutral
833	CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes, they are sent in separate chunk of the request.	Neutral
838	Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.	Neutral
841	Use FileUtils from Apache commons.	Neutral
842	Using you current code, make this tweak.	Neutral
849	You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.	Neutral
858	I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
866	What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
870	CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs, not CODE_FRAGMENTs.	Neutral
877	I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.	Neutral
879	Thanks in advance.	Neutral
882	FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.	Neutral
883	What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.	Neutral
886	You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.	Neutral
888	This example compiles and runs.	Neutral
893	This is what I have so far.	Neutral
895	Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.	Neutral
897	Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.	Neutral
898	Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.	Neutral
903	Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?	Neutral
907	I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.	Neutral
911	In a word, no.	Neutral

921	Try this.	Neutral
924	Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.	Neutral

944	Something like this.	Neutral
945	The answer from @hyde is valid, but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.	Neutral
946	Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.	Neutral
948	Hibernate related maven conf.	Neutral
949	Suggestions that I found were.	Neutral
954	Regarding your 6 points.	Neutral
956	User hibernate validation 4 +.	Neutral
959	It is integrated in Hibernate 4.	Neutral
967	You do that explicitly, but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.	Neutral
968	No, that not required/related.	Neutral
973	How do you use all these dependencies?	Neutral
976	That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.	Neutral
980	If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.	Neutral
989	Any ideas?	Neutral
1002	Also, the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.	Neutral
1005	And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1018	You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
1020	It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.	Neutral
1024	So, to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1030	Any tip?	Neutral
1032	You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1042	thanks in advance.	Neutral
1051	Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.	Neutral
1061	Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.	Neutral

1107	No-one's picked this up, but why are you trying to mock private methods?	Neutral
1111	Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.	Neutral
1124	jMock, mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.	Neutral
1128	Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009, that is! )	Neutral
1133	Here is a code that I have written.	Neutral
1134	When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.	Neutral
1142	See the documentation of FileWriter.	Neutral
1149	You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1160	Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.	Neutral
1166	you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1168	for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.	Neutral
1175	Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page, which would sleep for 5 seconds, then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.	Neutral
1177	Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?	Neutral
1180	Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.	Neutral
1184	On the client side, you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.	Neutral
1191	You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME, something like this.	Neutral
1193	Hope that helps.	Neutral
1199	to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).	Neutral
1205	Here it is.	Neutral
1206	Declare below string FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1208	This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.	Neutral
1212	or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.	Neutral
1221	You can try and do nothing about it.	Neutral
1224	( Come on, put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here, as suggested by @BaileyS. )	Neutral
1231	Only unchecked exception, compiler can skip to check.	Neutral
1240	There are 3 things you can do.	Neutral
1275	The short instruction is.	Neutral
1277	Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.	Neutral
1281	Suppose to have an FILE_NAME, say CODE_FRAGMENT, and two non-abstract subclasses, say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1283	E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
1284	which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.	Neutral
1285	Finally, if I try to deserialize as follows.	Neutral
1294	I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.	Neutral
1297	API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.	Neutral
743	Problem solved.	Positive
808	I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.	Positive
823	It will do the correct, ``legal ''stuff.	Positive
910	There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Positive
1011	But in the main case it works good enough.	Positive
1017	Stable and production ready lib.	Positive
1036	Not an extremely expensive operation I think.	Positive
1100	because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.	Positive
1102	This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.	Positive
1103	Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
1167	This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.	Positive
1171	They both seem to print out the list fine.	Positive
1320	Well a solution that works for me.	Positive
1223	That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).	Negative
1230	AS I know, it's impossible in the case.	Negative
1244	It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.	Negative

1328	See this official doc.	Neutral
1335	When the CODE_FRAGMENT command fails, it's almost always because of one of two things.	Neutral
1337	Make sure FILE_NAME dependencies in your manifest file point to jars, relative to FILE_NAME's parent directory.	Neutral
1339	Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1341	You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).	Neutral
1343	About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder, as you suggested, that's also possible.	Neutral
1344	Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1346	It simply adds all the.	Neutral
1347	jars within lib / folder to your classpath.	Neutral
1351	i have found out that i have to read the error log.	Neutral

1412	I'm considering making an Android app that integrates OData also.	Neutral
1414	I'm developing a mobile application.	Neutral
1422	I did some modification and in the end it was working, but it does not support odata functionallity ( queries like $filter, $oderby,... ) and for each request I need a new instance.	Neutral
1425	Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.	Neutral
1427	So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?	Neutral
1432	The mentioned components generate a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1442	If you want content, use the CODE_FRAGMENT element ( which isn't a void element ).	Neutral
1454	As long as your configuration doesn't change, you can create the Session once at the beginning and jsut keep using it.	Neutral
1472	I created a library project, exported it to a JAR file, and added to the build path of a couple of clients.	Neutral

1744	My task is the following.	Neutral
1751	Once you have the CODE_FRAGMENT, you can get to the CODE_FRAGMENT and the public and private keys.	Neutral
1754	Something along the lines of.	Neutral
1767	You need an RSA key for encryption, maybe you can switch your signature algorithm to RSA/SHA1 to avoid the need for two keys.	Neutral
1769	You do not need to do anything special.	Neutral
1772	Can you do something like this were Java is FILE_NAME library.	Neutral

1825	Any help appreciated.	Neutral
1835	You can then iterate through each departure element.	Neutral
1841	Here is an example of a row from the timetable.	Neutral
1847	Sorry, should've added more.	Neutral
1848	keyboard is what I named the Scanner.	Neutral
1849	This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.	Neutral
1850	If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?	Neutral
1853	The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.	Neutral
1856	When the line is empty, it will return an empty string, CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1861	you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.	Neutral
1865	Here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1866	And here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1871	I've separated the loop body into two statements for clarity, but it's equivalent to.	Neutral
1876	Your fields should generally be private.	Neutral
1877	Add public ``getter ''methods where necessary.	Neutral
1880	and to declare getters and setters for you fields.	Neutral
1882	And in your constructor, If you closeley look.	Neutral
1890	I want it to use id instead.	Neutral
1892	I have the same problem, I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.	Neutral
1895	then you will get CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1906	You need to inject LocalSessionFactoryBean into ObjectMapper.	Neutral

1529	It's ok.	Positive
1590	Here's a set of solutions to this challenge for both JDK types and Eclipse Collections types using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive

2022	There are many errors in this code.	Negative
2026	Used wrong column names which does not exist in the table.	Negative
2041	It's ugly and inefficient but it should work.	Negative
2120	Anyway, their current behavior does not allow what you want.	Negative
2127	It seems, that there must be some problem when genereting the response.	Negative
2128	I can successfully call my service but when generating the response, it seems to crash.	Negative
2130	But as far as I create the entitymanager - which not necessary has anything to do with the response - it crashes... ( I still respond with just 200 ).	Negative

2298	Bear in mind, that the above code might not compile ( I haven't tried it out myself... ).	Negative
2399	Not sure why but I am getting following error from my FILE_NAME.	Negative
1931	Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.	Neutral
1942	If you see the source code of this method you will see that.	Neutral
1948	This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.	Neutral
1950	The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.	Neutral
1951	That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE_FRAGMENT implementation.	Neutral
1967	Here is what the content of FILE_NAME ended up looking like.	Neutral
1970	What kind of a tool can I use to obfuscate/mask away my code similar to NewRelic `FILE_NAME?	Neutral
1971	I want to display only the headers of public functions.	Neutral
1983	JSTL will make the CODE_FRAGMENT tag available which can be used to iterate over you collection.	Neutral
1985	I am working on Spring MVC project in which I need to pass an object from my Controller to JSP and then I need to iterate that object and show them in a table FILE_NAME page.	Neutral
1986	Below is FILE_NAME which holds the data -.	Neutral
1992	Do I need to use JSTL for this?	Neutral
1993	Or there are any better approach for this?	Neutral
1994	We have a Java web application served from Apache Tomcat 6.	Neutral
1995	Our users are stored in a Windows 2008 R2 active directory.	Neutral
1996	The application connects to the AD using COM4J from the API_NAME library version NUMBER.	Neutral
2004	Finally, we found the problem.	Neutral
2005	It was caused by the scenario drawn at WEB_ADDRESS of Microsoft.	Neutral
2013	I am looking to plot cluster heat maps from gene expression data that I have.	Neutral
2018	I used Matthew Beckler's Java Heat Map a while ago.	Neutral
2023	Forgot ',' in Create Table Statements.	Neutral
2036	Updated code.	Neutral
2049	use an CODE_FRAGMENT and add a FILE_NAME if not in there already.	Neutral
2054	Regex Explained.	Neutral
2056	CODE_FRAGMENT creates a capturing group, to be referenced later.	Neutral
2067	Complexity is O ( N ).	Neutral
2072	You may try like this.	Neutral
2073	I try to split the String ``NUMBER ''to 2 new Strings.	Neutral
2074	but I get a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2076	You need to escape dot.	Neutral
2081	you have to use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2086	So, I thought I could create FILE_NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API_NAME code is in this answer.	Neutral
2088	So my Stream was finally.	Neutral
2094	The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.	Neutral
2097	Short answer.	Neutral
2101	I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.	Neutral
2102	Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2105	Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT, such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.	Neutral
2107	This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.	Neutral
2111	We want parallel treatment of our items.	Neutral
2114	More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.	Neutral
2121	I finally found my error!	Neutral
2142	You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.	Neutral
2145	What can be the reason of this warnings?	Neutral
2149	Someone saying here that.	Neutral
2151	Yes, i am using maven.	Neutral
2152	Here is my API_NAME.	Neutral
2155	Add this dependency to your API_NAME.	Neutral
2159	Write to file.	Neutral
2161	My logcat.	Neutral
2164	Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2165	CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2168	If so, you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.	Neutral
2172	An CODE_FRAGMENT is.	Neutral
2174	I have a Unix command to send email.	Neutral
2178	Please guide me on this problem.	Neutral
2185	Well... no.	Neutral
2186	CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.	Neutral
2187	That is, it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.	Neutral
2190	It depends: which type of equality do you want?	Neutral
2194	Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2195	CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.	Neutral
2196	Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
2203	Where Object is FILE_NAME you want.	Neutral
2204	I found work around from this post WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2206	First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.	Neutral
2209	Then you can consume the service and get a strongly typed list via.	Neutral
2217	Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?	Neutral
2220	From the articles I read, I kind of get the following.	Neutral
2226	for which you can specify the target directory.	Neutral
2228	If we move forward with this, this is what I envision.	Neutral
2229	If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.	Neutral
2240	2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.	Neutral
2241	3 ) Edit API_NAME configuration file ( in the `bower_component's folder ) and specify path for each js library components.	Neutral
2254	I have a native library that I call using JNI.	Neutral
2260	A few notes.	Neutral
2265	See NativeSystem.	Neutral
2269	Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.	Neutral
2270	Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.	Neutral
2272	Quite contrary, on Windows.	Neutral
2284	Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here, or.	Neutral
2287	It will read a byte each time here.	Neutral
2290	Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.	Neutral
2292	After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2293	and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.	Neutral
2295	On a sidenote.	Neutral
2312	CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.	Neutral
2315	This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).	Neutral
2322	Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding, use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.	Neutral
2323	Edit: - Missed to add one imp line, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2343	As to your point.	Neutral
2349	The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.	Neutral
2353	That shouldn't be an issue though.	Neutral
2363	It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.	Neutral
2365	Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.	Neutral
2366	You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.	Neutral
2380	And then for FILE_NAME we have.	Neutral
2382	Examples of FILE_NAME names include.	Neutral
2386	Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form.	Neutral
2387	modified_package_name / name.	Neutral
2397	Hope this helps anyone out there!	Neutral
2403	WEB_ADDRESS #setString% API_NAME,% API_NAME% 29.	Neutral
2415	Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2418	I have modified your code to add them.	Neutral
2421	Please refer to the code below.	Neutral
2423	I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.	Neutral
2425	And my Gradle File looks like this.	Neutral
2430	where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2432	If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.	Neutral
2433	So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.	Neutral
2435	I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.	Neutral
2437	InsertandRetriveBlobData.	Neutral
2456	Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.	Neutral
2461	You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.	Neutral
2463	Once you have a complete message, you need to process it.	Neutral
2470	Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage, current, temperature etc. ).	Neutral
2471	I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.	Neutral
2475	Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.	Neutral
2477	this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.	Neutral
1879	I suggest you to use.	Positive
1930	Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.	Positive
2137	This works for me.	Positive
2202	For me this worked.	Positive
2225	Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.	Positive
2231	It does its job, but was built for our use case.	Positive
2271	That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.	Positive
2364	I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.	Positive
2367	I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.	Positive
2396	So this works.	Positive
2545	In lieu of that, however, in my experience, ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity, flexibility, and ease-of-use.	Positive
2649	As others have already said, JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.	Positive
2669	There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.	Positive
2468	The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.	Negative
2479	since a day I have a very annoying problem - I can't run any Spring MVC application: / Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation.	Negative
2533	Any idea what i might be doing wrong.	Negative
2575	I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.	Negative
2578	Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.	Negative
2584	i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.	Negative
2606	I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism, as it would produce a lot of overhead.	Negative
2656	I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query, it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.	Negative
2705	Less margin for error.	Negative
2745	Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.	Negative
2796	I was unable to get a perfect match.	Negative
2824	I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally.	Negative
2841	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!	Negative
2862	There is, of course, an API for the DRL compiler's parser, but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax, which is considerable.	Negative
2872	I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.	Negative
2899	But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.	Negative
2928	This is an absurd, unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.	Negative
2938	First of all I do not think you need all these.	Negative
2480	So i created this from scratch.	Neutral
2482	and of course API_NAME.	Neutral
2490	it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.	Neutral
2493	What am I missing???	Neutral
2495	However, you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.	Neutral
2497	It's documentation can be found here.	Neutral
2506	a way to get FILE_NAME type, thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.	Neutral
2519	In a word: No.	Neutral
2522	What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?	Neutral
2523	Which one should be reported?	Neutral
2526	You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them.	Neutral
2531	Using this, i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.	Neutral
2536	Some other pointer.	Neutral
2538	I am using API_NAME for encoding.	Neutral
2540	Working Python Code.	Neutral
2541	I'm looking for a well-maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API.	Neutral
2556	Take a look at this article.	Neutral
2579	Maybe you could do the same that he did, i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?	Neutral
2580	( see: this answer ).	Neutral
2583	how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?	Neutral
2602	There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.	Neutral
2604	I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.	Neutral
2605	How is blocking performed?	Neutral
2608	No, they don't use busy-waiting.	Neutral
2609	It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.	Neutral
2611	the exception is on line 72 and 114.	Neutral
2613	Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).	Neutral
2628	This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x, hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.	Neutral
2635	One which is the Pro full API.	Neutral
2637	I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.	Neutral
2641	When you build, you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus, artifactory, etc ), and then you would have 2 separate jars.	Neutral
2643	A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.	Neutral
2644	You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.	Neutral
2645	Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.	Neutral
2650	You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method, since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.	Neutral
2661	What I would like to do, take any random XML, and create object which will contain timestamps, integers, strings as well maps, basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure.	Neutral
2665	Is there better way than to do it manually?	Neutral
2683	Component scan configuration file.	Neutral
2689	In a FILE_NAME code base in my recent job, I see the below code.	Neutral
2691	Are there examples you have that could shed light on the above MapHelper's usefulness?	Neutral

2897	I took help from this Question.	Neutral
2901	System prints data like this.	Neutral
2910	If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.	Neutral
2914	So, basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.	Neutral
2918	You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.	Neutral
2920	Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2921	It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.	Neutral
2922	UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII, two bytes for many europe languages.	Neutral
2923	Also each String object contains reference to char array.	Neutral
2926	So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2941	And then in your other file.	Neutral
2948	Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2951	But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the API_NAME.	Neutral
2959	In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.	Neutral

3003	Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?	Neutral
3007	FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.	Neutral
3015	My API_NAME seems to include the reference.	Neutral
3020	Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3029	As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,.	Neutral
3031	I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.	Neutral
3032	I have also tried to use.	Neutral
3037	( In this case I would have used.	Neutral
3050	Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.	Neutral
3055	so, how we can parse above like example expression easier, or FILE_NAME api for string parser.	Neutral
3076	This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
3080	Now I want this, when the user check a shipper by EditTextView, I have from database an Object.	Neutral
3081	I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.	Neutral
3082	Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.	Neutral
3084	So instead of setting Bundle to null, you can do something like this.	Neutral
3085	Check out this link for more info.	Neutral
3099	I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call,.	Neutral
3106	This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.	Neutral
2761	Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.	Positive
2805	Solved, in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.	Positive
2904	Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.	Positive
2907	This solution is more flexible.	Positive
2940	but if you want you can do this.	Positive
2942	I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.	Positive
2953	With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.	Positive
3173	There are many ways to solve it, the simplest is call.	Positive
3185	The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.	Positive
3226	You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.	Positive
3337	Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT, useful for quantifier syntax.	Positive
3404	The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3427	In any case, manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.	Positive
2958	This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.	Negative
2965	But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.	Negative
2971	then I gets the module error again from JNA.	Negative
2999	This line gives the error.	Negative
3024	I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.	Negative
3132	And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
3134	But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.	Negative
3172	You have problem with classpath.	Negative
3186	Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.	Negative
3214	I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.	Negative
3244	If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.	Negative

3366	They all fail with the following error.	Negative
3382	The following is the error I keep getting.	Negative
3396	But it isn't working like I expected.	Negative
3398	But unexpectedly, I am getting 66.	Negative
3430	As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.	Negative
3569	Why is it reading it wrongly?	Negative
3107	I'm new to FILE_NAME language.	Neutral
3126	In Java, you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.	Neutral
3135	Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. )	Neutral
3145	If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java, use a FILE_NAME.	Neutral
3163	So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3193	When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.	Neutral
3212	I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.	Neutral
3224	Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it, loop through it, create a Comparator etc..	Neutral
3232	I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.	Neutral
3238	You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.	Neutral
3250	I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.	Neutral
3256	The program is just a hello world Program.	Neutral
3267	You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.	Neutral
3269	CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.	Neutral
3282	( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes, though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. )	Neutral
3288	Finally, ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.	Neutral
3290	So you can do.	Neutral
3294	One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.	Neutral
3300	The code in Java is.	Neutral
3302	What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.	Neutral
3321	This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.	Neutral
3322	Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3323	Are they equivalent?	Neutral
3340	I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.	Neutral
3341	They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3346	I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.	Neutral
3352	So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.	Neutral
3359	Try to download *.	Neutral
3361	May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.	Neutral
3368	Let me know if there are any other details that might help!	Neutral
3370	Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3372	Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.	Neutral
3389	Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).	Neutral
3393	For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3395	I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.	Neutral
3407	If you want to print a int as binary, use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.	Neutral
3409	Version of Spring is NUMBER.	Neutral
3410	I have a session bean, declared as.	Neutral
3413	After debugging, i found out, that when test spring context is started, in the.	Neutral
3422	You can add a util method to your test, something like.	Neutral
3426	In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3429	See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.	Neutral
3432	However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.	Neutral
3435	Obviously, the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT, but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT, etc..	Neutral
3438	Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ).	Neutral
3445	And DispatherConfig is this.	Neutral
3446	Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.	Neutral
3448	hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.	Neutral
3453	Let's put your code inside a method.	Neutral
3454	If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.	Neutral
3457	If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.	Neutral
3462	The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp, which access the Oracle database.	Neutral
3463	This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.	Neutral
3464	Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?	Neutral
3468	Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java, see if this works for you.	Neutral
3469	Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.	Neutral
3472	When I run this on Windows, the console tells me.	Neutral
3484	Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?	Neutral
3487	Note, however, it's called CODE_FRAGMENT, with a capital D.	Neutral
3492	Question 2: From the javadoc.	Neutral
3493	So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.	Neutral
3502	But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3510	What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.	Neutral
3514	Something like below,.	Neutral
3524	Hope it clarifies.	Neutral
3539	I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.	Neutral
3548	Which outputs.	Neutral
3553	I have a string like this.	Neutral
3554	Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.	Neutral
3556	url WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3557	is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?	Neutral
3564	I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.	Neutral
3568	And I got the output like this.	Neutral
3577	mm stands for minutes.	Neutral
3584	So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.	Neutral
3589	Accourding to this answer.	Neutral
3592	IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.	Neutral
3596	and call the client as follows.	Neutral
3598	The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.	Neutral

3616	Hi I have a sample log file here.	Neutral
3630	The API_NAME ( String regex,.	Neutral
3632	You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.	Neutral
3634	The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.	Neutral
3656	To stop this runnable, you have to call this when needed.	Neutral
3661	And a string contains the name of the enum.	Neutral
3665	You have to do it like this.	Neutral
3666	Here's an alternative way.	Neutral
3669	Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.	Neutral
3683	Here is the actual data sent.	Neutral
3703	I think you also have to look at the database configuration.	Neutral
3709	The package gets deleted in the registry.	Neutral

3752	FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).	Neutral
3753	Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.	Neutral
3755	You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.	Neutral
3758	In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?	Neutral
3759	I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work, scope wise.	Neutral
3761	I am curious about the problem I have proposed.	Neutral
3768	Thank you in advance!	Neutral
3772	That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.	Neutral
3780	But, i didn't give me the thing i need!	Neutral
3781	How can i do that?	Neutral
3785	Since CODE_FRAGMENT is a meta character, and it's have a special meaning in regex.	Neutral

3797	I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.	Neutral
3811	What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?	Neutral
3824	You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.	Neutral
3844	If so, then how far does this go; for example, could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?	Neutral
3847	I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.	Neutral
3480	The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.	Positive
3547	The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.	Positive
3560	It seems, after a quick google search, that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3562	This might prove to be useful unbescape.	Positive
3635	Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length, the simplest solution is.	Positive
3922	There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.	Positive
3941	Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.	Positive
4055	That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.	Positive
4126	And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.	Positive
4261	Ok, I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).	Positive
4423	Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.	Positive
4570	That's correct behavior.	Positive

3639	I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.	Negative
3679	The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.	Negative
3681	I tried the following and it returns nothing.	Negative
3798	I searched a lot but i not found any solution.	Negative
3842	What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?	Negative
3848	When I tried to compile the tool, I get n error.	Negative
3853	I don't know what else to do to make things to work.	Negative
3897	I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.	Negative
3927	I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ), but it is not displaying.	Negative
3935	I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT, but there is none.	Negative
3965	but still nothing.	Negative
4040	But it's not necessary for our case.	Negative
4079	Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.	Negative
4109	I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.	Negative
4141	I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.	Negative
4149	I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.	Negative
3851	I also have set JAVA_HOME.	Neutral
3855	Use full path in ANT_HOME, eg.	Neutral
3856	It dependes where it is exactly located.	Neutral
3865	Thanks and Greeting!	Neutral
3872	So the question is.	Neutral
3887	If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ), they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.	Neutral
3888	This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.	Neutral
3894	try this type code.	Neutral
3899	In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.	Neutral
3901	and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).	Neutral
3905	If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.	Neutral
3907	If you need to shorten the button code, Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.	Neutral
3909	Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.	Neutral
3915	You can use syntax like.	Neutral
3916	I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.	Neutral
3919	In your code, you need to replace.	Neutral
3920	Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.	Neutral
3921	Which creates the file writer in append mode, see the docs here.	Neutral
3928	Here is a MacOSX MenuBar.	Neutral
3929	Below is my code.	Neutral
3931	I am running the program as a Java Application.	Neutral
3937	Some technical details.	Neutral
3938	I am using Java SE version NUMBER.	Neutral
3939	My computer's OS is Mac OS X NUMBER.	Neutral
3948	You can see in the code above I use this to call my bean in the other proyect.	Neutral
3950	I also tried using this.	Neutral
3959	Wildfly Developer Guide.	Neutral
3963	The code i am using is.	Neutral
3966	Assume you have this directory layout.	Neutral
3983	What's happening?	Neutral
3992	I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.	Neutral
3993	It started about a month ago, after a deployment.	Neutral
4001	CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.	Neutral
4004	As part of GC, first minor GC is triggered.	Neutral
4007	I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?	Neutral
4013	So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.	Neutral
4018	You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4020	Also, based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject, the unit is milliseconds, not seconds.	Neutral
4021	Try these longer term things in the long term.	Neutral
4022	If you can, try the G1GC collector.	Neutral
4023	You are using Java 7, so if you can in your current environment, give it a try.	Neutral
4024	It's meant for performance with big heaps.	Neutral
4030	Remember, the bigger the heap, the longer the garbage collector takes, irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.	Neutral
4031	You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.	Neutral
4038	Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.	Neutral
4043	At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4046	You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints, and still receive compile-time verification.	Neutral
4047	One way would be.	Neutral
4050	FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.	Neutral
4052	( If you're not using Java 8, it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one, and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )	Neutral
4054	You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4060	Thanks alot!	Neutral

4178	And all injections occurs just once - on application starting.	Neutral
4182	Let's find out, how scoped beans do work.	Neutral
4189	Now, about scoped proxies.	Neutral
4191	This means, that every time you will operate on the exact same object, that was originally injected on start.	Neutral
4194	To do it, as said in documentation, declare you bean as proxified.	Neutral
4197	CODE_FRAGMENT working almost same way.	Neutral
4204	The text file has 10 lines of data and each line contains a piece of data in the format of: ``Integer1-String1: String2 ''example:`` 123-ABC: DEFG''.	Neutral
4212	You might want to create a FILE_NAME for your data.	Neutral
4224	Obtain the raw lines and keep them in a ( Clojure ) lazy sequence.	Neutral
4247	On the right side of notification android is showing time.	Neutral
4252	Refer more than here: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
4257	Currently, I create the index like so.	Neutral
4260	Any help will be greatly appreciated.	Neutral
4263	Create your index like so.	Neutral
4264	And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.	Neutral
4266	To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.	Neutral
4274	Why not?	Neutral
4277	What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.	Neutral
4278	It isn't, not at least at JPA level.	Neutral
4283	This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.	Neutral
4284	( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).	Neutral
4292	Currently, I have a method.	Neutral
4293	The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.	Neutral
4307	CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).	Neutral
4310	There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory, so you're done.	Neutral
4313	All of that can just go.	Neutral
4327	I have set up the Interface as follows.	Neutral
4330	where mOut is an ActivityInterface.	Neutral
4332	If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4341	Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.	Neutral
4353	That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int, int ) can not be referenced from a static context '', because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.	Neutral
4358	Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.	Neutral
4362	I inject the beans with AutowireHelper.	Neutral
4378	Recently, I tried to implement the AppBarLayout with tabs.	Neutral
4380	I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4382	And here is the result in an emulator.	Neutral
4385	Here is the XML layout.	Neutral
4386	There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.	Neutral
4387	WEB_ADDRESS #UNWRAP_ROOT_VALUE - see FILE_NAME #WRAP_ROOT_VALUE as well.	Neutral
4389	Config example for spring is available at.	Neutral
4391	I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.	Neutral
4395	How do I achieve this?	Neutral
4398	Is there a configuration for Jackson/Spring that I am missing?	Neutral
4400	The complete error message is.	Neutral
4401	Just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4403	I tried below code and I got this output.	Neutral
4409	HashSet ( Java Platform SE 8 ) says.	Neutral
4413	We have a requirement to show only -LCB- RED, BLUE -RCB- in a certain user interface?	Neutral
4415	see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4652	Thank you dunni for your help, you've put me on the right path.	Positive
4654	And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.	Positive
4710	but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.	Positive
4711	Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.	Positive
4737	FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.	Positive
4847	This answer describes what is happening more clearly.	Positive
4853	For example, the following works great.	Positive
4897	It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.	Positive
4982	Comparison time should be fast, so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.	Positive
5005	Congratulations.	Positive
5007	Databases are much better at handling data than Java.	Positive
5008	Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster, with less CPU, less memory and less network traffic.	Positive
5015	Embrace the Joy of Sets!	Positive
4167	I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib, but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.	Negative
4275	This is your problem.	Negative
4295	This is not my intention.	Negative
4333	I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.	Negative
4551	This isn't valid Java.	Negative
4578	Well, the funny part is, we do not know.	Negative
4596	The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.	Negative
4636	This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.	Negative
4637	The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4645	I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.	Negative
4698	The problem is that you wrote.	Negative
4775	I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4812	I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4813	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.	Negative
4841	CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.	Negative
4861	Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.	Negative

4940	Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.	Negative
4420	See from Javadocs of String #compareTo.	Neutral
4422	I have a service which writes input stream to a file.	Neutral
4426	FILE_NAME: 30 line is basically CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4429	As I read more into the article, I see that there is an API that looks like this.	Neutral
4430	If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).	Neutral
4431	Would I in theory, be able to send a notification with whatever information I want to that device?	Neutral
4442	If you use the XMPP protocol.	Neutral
4443	You should implement a connection server that manages the connection to FCM to handle upstream and downstream messages.	Neutral
4453	Applet and JSP Communication.	Neutral
4454	I have tomcat hosting my website FILE_NAME api for database management.	Neutral
4458	Anyone have any idea on the problem?	Neutral
4462	I know the question is very broad but please help me thanks.	Neutral
4469	You can read more about it here.	Neutral
4470	i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.	Neutral
4477	Either pass 4 digit year or fix your pattern.	Neutral
4478	Maybe i found a solution to your problem.	Neutral
4485	Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core, tomcat-embed-websocket, tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )	Neutral
4489	Thanks in advance!	Neutral
4490	I am writing a cloud-sync application in Java with.	Neutral
4496	P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.	Neutral
4498	Thank you for any hint.	Neutral
4499	I just found a solution for Java NUMBER + in combination with native and jni dlls.	Neutral
4507	In my CODE_FRAGMENT script I have.	Neutral
4508	The repository description on MVNrepository lists several compile dependencies, including Selenium-Chrome-Driver, Selenium-FirefoSMILE_FACEriver, etc..	Neutral
4513	The image below shows that it's being compiled from the Maven script.	Neutral
4516	So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver, you need to.	Neutral
4522	How to do that is explained here.	Neutral
4527	You don't have to base64-encode the access token before use.	Neutral
4532	Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.	Neutral
4544	Concept of atomicity comes when something is mutable.	Neutral
4556	The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.	Neutral
4568	When you add 3 hours, you will get March 30, 2010 02:00 UTC.	Neutral
4572	Precisely at March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC, so March 30, 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30, 2010: 01:59 CEST, but March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30, 2010 03:00 CEST.	Neutral
4575	In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.	Neutral
4580	That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying, otherwise you risk an ambiguity.	Neutral
4583	Here is an example ( please, note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).	Neutral
4588	When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!	Neutral
4590	Where is my mistake?	Neutral
4600	I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.	Neutral
4602	You might do something like this.	Neutral
4613	Omitted time zone.	Neutral
4615	Should have been translated to UTC time.	Neutral
4619	Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4620	No Midnight.	Neutral
4624	Some comments about this source code.	Neutral
4626	Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.	Neutral
4647	EAR dependencies.	Neutral
4648	The datasource should load from jndi, this is my API_NAME.	Neutral
4653	And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4659	i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.	Neutral
4666	You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.	Neutral
4671	I want to ask some questions.	Neutral
4677	( My question is here, how to list the music on JScrollPane?? )	Neutral
4679	If i double click each music ( sample1, sample2 ), the music that I choose is playing.	Neutral
4682	I want the music's name that I choose.	Neutral
4684	like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )	Neutral
4689	I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4699	But you should have written.	Neutral
4700	I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7,.	Neutral
4701	I can send POST request with this code.	Neutral
4713	Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.	Neutral
4714	startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusive.	Neutral
4717	To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.	Neutral
4726	Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.	Neutral
4727	This is a list in python.	Neutral
4728	This is how the slice operator would work.	Neutral
4746	OutputRaw solve me issue.	Neutral
4747	I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).	Neutral
4749	Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..	Neutral
4752	So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4761	The output that I get is -.	Neutral
4770	The statement should have been.	Neutral
4779	Here is what I have now.	Neutral
4780	Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!	Neutral
4783	ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).	Neutral
4788	That said, you have a couple options.	Neutral
4789	You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.	Neutral
4793	This would look like.	Neutral
4795	I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.	Neutral
4796	Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.	Neutral
4814	Just delete the method.	Neutral
4815	CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.	Neutral
4817	Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4823	Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).	Neutral
4826	I cant use Date format,, only string.	Neutral
4835	Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).	Neutral
4842	But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.	Neutral
4843	More details in thread.	Neutral
4848	In my case, I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.	Neutral
4859	The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.	Neutral
4863	Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.	Neutral
4865	can not be cast to API_NAME.	Neutral
4873	The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.	Neutral
4874	---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.	Neutral
4875	I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here, such as Velocity and FreeMarker.	Neutral
4883	The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).	Neutral
4885	I have 2D closed vector paths, specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.	Neutral
4905	I expect to do a system when you can do a survey, and then, press a button, open a new activity and see survey answers.	Neutral
4908	Here is my code of the survey, XML and JAVA.	Neutral
4913	like this just capture all user input data, No need for the database in this.	Neutral
4914	Here list is the list of all question you are having....	Neutral
4916	getQuestion and similarly with answer.	Neutral
4918	I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.	Neutral
4924	In this situation, when I click on the greyed out widget, I need to start the app.	Neutral
4926	how I could achieve this.	Neutral
4930	You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4948	Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.	Neutral
4949	Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT, because the latter only processes public fields.	Neutral
4953	Let's assume my model looks like this.	Neutral
4957	I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.	Neutral
4961	Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.	Neutral
4966	Plese guide.	Neutral
4967	Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required, NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).	Neutral
4968	Targetting to achieve.	Neutral
4969	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string, e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4970	If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.	Neutral
4984	New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.	Neutral
4990	Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4996	Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.	Neutral
5026	I understand the boolean expression here.	Positive
5052	If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way, try CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5073	This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.	Positive
5244	Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.	Positive
5262	it's worth a shot.	Positive
5324	I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.	Positive
5381	It's really good.	Positive
5382	It's an excellent, fast library.	Positive
5408	At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.	Positive
5497	check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.	Positive
5518	This works fine.	Positive
5600	It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5626	The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.	Positive
4942	Because it's not initialized yet.	Negative
4945	( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
4947	I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT, but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.	Negative
5101	Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.	Negative
5128	Data loss.	Negative
5219	When I run the project, I get the following error,.	Negative
5256	As you can see, the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering, it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.	Negative
5307	As others have stated, this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.	Negative
5310	We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.	Negative
5364	All seems OK, but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).	Negative
5385	... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.	Negative
5409	I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
5478	( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )	Negative
5542	It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.	Negative
5567	I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5607	Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work, unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.	Negative
5623	There is a caveat with the above approach.	Negative
5636	It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.	Negative
5003	Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT, iterating the submap, giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.	Neutral
5016	Hmmm.	Neutral
5027	But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?	Neutral
5030	So you can see, since CODE_FRAGMENT, exception is not thrown.	Neutral
5034	Can you help in understanding this code.	Neutral
5035	Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.	Neutral
5056	In the code you referenced, readLine is called on a BufferedReader.	Neutral
5061	An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.	Neutral
5063	The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.	Neutral
5071	In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.	Neutral
5078	Here's an example of a JSON structure.	Neutral
5079	Here it's the function that parses the json.	Neutral
5082	I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic, I don't always know what structure will come from it.	Neutral
5087	Can I use a recursive function?	Neutral
5093	Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.	Neutral
5113	Consider the following interface.	Neutral
5114	Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.	Neutral
5115	Now consider the following FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5122	Avoid legacy date-time classes.	Neutral
5129	The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.	Neutral
5133	Instead, use API_NAME classes.	Neutral
5135	When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT, immediately convert to API_NAME types.	Neutral
5137	In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7, use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5138	An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
5141	API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.	Neutral
5144	To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial.	Neutral
5146	Specification is JSR 310.	Neutral
5161	Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?	Neutral
5165	Use it.	Neutral
5168	You probably mean.	Neutral
5172	e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5173	I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.	Neutral
5174	The regex is.	Neutral
5176	I am using this.	Neutral
5184	You can use this regex.	Neutral
5185	You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.	Neutral
5196	If so, please show an example.	Neutral
5203	What is best practice while testing Android Services?	Neutral
5208	After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process, following the instructions from here, I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.	Neutral
5218	I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below,.	Neutral
5220	I took several measures,.	Neutral
5223	What should I do to solve the issue?	Neutral
5225	I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.	Neutral
5233	How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?	Neutral
5257	Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?	Neutral
5258	Graphics Initialization.	Neutral
5260	I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.	Neutral
5267	See here.	Neutral
5275	url: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5284	I've given an example below.	Neutral
5293	There are several options.	Neutral
5295	Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.	Neutral
5317	Since that time we've tended more toward option two.	Neutral
5322	I will post it here if I find anything new.	Neutral
5325	But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.	Neutral
5333	you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.	Neutral
5339	and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.	Neutral
5342	There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.	Neutral
5344	This is especially true for long lived callbacks.	Neutral
5347	Otherwise, it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.	Neutral
5359	Here is the code that does the push.	Neutral
5365	Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).	Neutral
5370	For the records, I found it ;o).	Neutral
5372	For deails see Adobe forums thread.	Neutral
5374	Enjoy and thank you for your time!	Neutral
5378	FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.	Neutral
5392	Or simply use Maven repository.	Neutral
5394	Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.	Neutral
5395	Add other jars from your JDK.	Neutral
5397	All projects will see the changed JRE definition.	Neutral
5437	See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.	Neutral
5438	( And please reformat your code ).	Neutral
5446	The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.	Neutral
5448	The customer leaves the salon.	Neutral
5450	If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.	Neutral
5454	I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.	Neutral
5463	You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.	Neutral
5464	As long as the customer does not enter the saloon, it holds NotSleeping.	Neutral
5480	Here's an example.	Neutral
5484	In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.	Neutral
5489	Use FILE_NAME instead of float.	Neutral
5490	And use Java code like this.	Neutral
5491	I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5498	If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.	Neutral
5500	For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
5505	How can i solve it.	Neutral
5509	Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it, the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5512	Well, you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5517	You have to new it up.	Neutral
5519	Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT, this will help.	Neutral
5523	I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.	Neutral
5525	The FILE_NAME looks like this.	Neutral
5537	Check if your Table has that style bit.	Neutral
5539	I added.	Neutral
5548	Here is an example in Java.	Neutral
5551	To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5552	Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.	Neutral
5559	After the request is done, all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.	Neutral
5561	The output looks like this.	Neutral
5563	When that is ready I shall post the code.	Neutral
5565	An usage example.	Neutral

5593	To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.	Neutral
5613	Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.	Neutral

5708	I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.	Neutral
5720	May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?	Neutral
5724	I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.	Neutral
5658	Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.	Positive
5668	But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.	Positive
5671	I still think it's not the best design, but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.	Positive
5680	Or since in NUMBER% of cases, day will be correct.	Positive
5685	The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.	Positive
5694	Even in your own parsing approach, you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.	Positive
5707	This should almost be obvious.	Positive

5779	You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.	Neutral
5780	This website shows how.	Neutral

5790	I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.	Neutral
5795	Was being sent from the server to the client.	Neutral
5801	If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).	Neutral
5806	UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.	Neutral

5827	When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ), retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT, but this time without a host name.	Neutral
5842	Alarmingly, my customer has discovered a setting in the Java control panel which resolves this.	Neutral
5849	Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.	Neutral
5862	Restart your Tomcat ( important ).	Neutral
5863	Just to add a solution here.	Neutral
5868	My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.	Neutral
5877	The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.	Neutral
5880	Btw, you can also try apache http components.	Neutral
5900	You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.	Neutral

5915	I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.	Neutral
5933	Basically, the component type is mandatory for JSF in order to create the component by CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
5936	The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5944	tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.	Neutral
5951	I have just a quick question: Are files created before they are finished, or are they finished and then created?	Neutral

5984	whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.	Neutral
6001	The length of the appointments, the span of time not yet attached to the timeline, should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6004	Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT, FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.	Neutral
6007	For example, 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN, and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.	Neutral
6008	You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.	Neutral
6018	CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.	Neutral
6024	When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time, combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6030	Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.	Neutral
6031	Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.	Neutral
6032	We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.	Neutral
6036	The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
6038	Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.	Neutral
6040	We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
6048	The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration API_NAME.	Neutral

6190	Then what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6191	While working with netbeans I have to make a new file of category CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6192	What is a CODE_FRAGMENT and what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6203	Jar file check following link.	Neutral
6205	Hope it will help you.	Neutral
6218	So what do you think?	Neutral
6221	Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.	Neutral
6222	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6224	Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.	Neutral
6225	It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.	Neutral
6229	Since this is homework, here's some hints.	Neutral
6236	To clarify, a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.	Neutral
6240	Let's look at a sample call.	Neutral
6248	You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!	Neutral
6254	and finally here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
6273	Assuming instance variables, frst way, EC, CC, PT are ZERO.	Neutral
6280	CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.	Neutral
6289	No, it's not the same.	Neutral
6294	only HC will be initialized.	Neutral
6295	all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).	Neutral
6298	You can also do it as follows.	Neutral
6299	First declare all variables.	Neutral
6300	Then assign value.	Neutral
6302	If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC, CC, PT and HC values are one.	Neutral

6305	I'm trying to post comments on an app page in Facebook.	Neutral
6310	From what i have found the only API that is almost up to date is RestFB.	Neutral
6319	Is this api up to date?	Neutral
6321	Furthermore is there any other better api?	Neutral
6325	Here is the code that i am using to post a comment.	Neutral
6330	I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.	Neutral
6331	Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?	Neutral
6340	#NAME?	Neutral
6347	I tried something like this.	Neutral
6348	The result was byte [ ].	Neutral
6356	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.	Neutral
6358	As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.	Neutral
6361	Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components, and the progress bar can be customized.	Neutral
6363	Say, after several text appended to a text area, I want this to be appended.	Neutral
6364	``Please wait, a download is in progress ''.	Neutral
6365	After that a download progress status with progress meter character '#' gets appended.	Neutral
5927	The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.	Positive
5990	Also, JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler.	Positive
6077	The option reduces heap usage.	Positive
6080	For workloads that are memory capacity constrained ( i.e. have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time ), this option can prove useful.	Positive
6089	CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example, instead of copying.	Positive
6094	With the new design, they could also support other encodings in future.	Positive
6102	API_NAME can be used.	Positive
6106	Here's a good example from Jetty's wiki page WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
6144	Using consistent indentation and sensible whitespace can make your code much easier to read.	Positive
6184	Very good example of steady pooling readHere.	Positive
6238	Now we're getting to the good part.	Positive
6308	So far i've done this for Twitter and it works very well.	Positive
6328	I solved the earlier problem.	Positive
6359	Addendum: CODE_FRAGMENT is useful for managing lengthy background tasks while displaying interim progress.	Positive
6	But sadly this is not working.	Negative
78	So, everything builds fine, but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.	Negative
90	That is what is causing your null pointer exception.	Negative
139	All attempts I've made were, in a shortcut, unsuccessful.	Negative
162	Don't use.	Negative
187	However when I try to run FILE_NAME, it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.	Negative
200	Problem: without zooming, the added content doesn't get visible.	Negative
201	in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size, but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.	Negative
256	else your GUI will be Hanged.	Negative
342	I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast.	Negative
361	But the above code doesn't work outside the ``FILE_NAME JavaAgent`` FILE_NAME of the main Agent.	Negative
436	Please note there is a bug in FILE_NAME, L996 +997.	Negative
444	I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.	Negative
448	the problem is the following.	Negative
491	When I run my client, it throws the following exception.	Negative
521	i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.	Negative
526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral
181	I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.	Neutral
183	resources/API _ NAME creation option: package required library into FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
191	While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system, most other applications can not.	Neutral
196	Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.	Neutral
204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
580	This is the first time I've encountered something like below.	Negative
583	NOT WORKING: directly compiled the src on Unix machine and used FILE_NAME files.	Negative
587	For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.	Negative
617	It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.	Negative
619	Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.	Negative
653	Eclipse error: `Failed to create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Negative
726	But unfortunately it can not be used!!!	Negative
832	Maybe there are some problems with the path of the file ( on my pc )!?!?	Negative

994	I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.	Negative
1027	I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).	Negative
1079	I wanted to see all the files I have in my external storage, I have this library that display the text to the user, but when I'm using it to show the sub files, it says something like.	Negative
1152	A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).	Negative
648	This should read all files in the single input directory.	Neutral
650	It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Neutral
658	Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.	Neutral
663	Another option may be the Factory pattern.	Neutral
665	Of course you can combine both.	Neutral
672	You could use a kind of strategy.	Neutral
681	This way, you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.	Neutral
685	Hope it helps.	Neutral
689	You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.	Neutral
691	In some cases there is a trade that you need to do, thus you should take into account your project's requirements.	Neutral
698	Tried just to see the response.	Neutral
706	I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.	Neutral
713	I have downloaded a few Android applications from Google Play.	Neutral
714	I have got CODE_FRAGMENT code through reverse engineering tool CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
717	Is there any way to generate call graphs automatically?	Neutral
727	thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby, which can be found in here.	Neutral
731	and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.	Neutral
734	Do you have any hints to avoid this error?	Neutral
739	Thank you!	Neutral
740	Gotcha!	Neutral
744	The full story here!	Neutral
764	So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.	Neutral
778	I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.	Neutral
779	I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).	Neutral
784	The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.	Neutral
794	In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.	Neutral
810	Find out more.	Neutral
816	How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? )	Neutral
819	Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.	Neutral
822	Trust URI.	Neutral
833	CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes, they are sent in separate chunk of the request.	Neutral
838	Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.	Neutral
841	Use FileUtils from Apache commons.	Neutral
842	Using you current code, make this tweak.	Neutral
849	You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.	Neutral
858	I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
866	What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
870	CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs, not CODE_FRAGMENTs.	Neutral
877	I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.	Neutral
879	Thanks in advance.	Neutral
882	FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.	Neutral
883	What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.	Neutral
886	You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.	Neutral
888	This example compiles and runs.	Neutral
893	This is what I have so far.	Neutral
895	Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.	Neutral
897	Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.	Neutral
898	Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.	Neutral
903	Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?	Neutral
907	I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.	Neutral
911	In a word, no.	Neutral
913	I've a program test to see if the user input is a positive number and an integer.	Neutral
921	Try this.	Neutral
924	Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.	Neutral
934	convert PDF to SVG characters with font, size, x/y, etc. ( PDFBox does this ).	Neutral
937	attempt to interpret the areas as cells of rectangular tables.	Neutral
944	Something like this.	Neutral
945	The answer from @hyde is valid, but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.	Neutral
946	Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.	Neutral
948	Hibernate related maven conf.	Neutral
949	Suggestions that I found were.	Neutral
954	Regarding your 6 points.	Neutral
956	User hibernate validation 4 +.	Neutral
959	It is integrated in Hibernate 4.	Neutral
967	You do that explicitly, but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.	Neutral
968	No, that not required/related.	Neutral
973	How do you use all these dependencies?	Neutral
976	That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.	Neutral
980	If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.	Neutral
989	Any ideas?	Neutral
1002	Also, the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.	Neutral
1005	And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1018	You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
1020	It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.	Neutral
1024	So, to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1030	Any tip?	Neutral
1032	You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1042	thanks in advance.	Neutral
1051	Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.	Neutral
1061	Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.	Neutral
1063	The source code is.	Neutral

1094	Any ideas are appreciated.	Neutral
1107	No-one's picked this up, but why are you trying to mock private methods?	Neutral
1111	Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.	Neutral
1124	jMock, mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.	Neutral
1128	Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009, that is! )	Neutral
1133	Here is a code that I have written.	Neutral
1134	When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.	Neutral
1142	See the documentation of FileWriter.	Neutral
1149	You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1160	Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.	Neutral
1166	you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1168	for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.	Neutral
1175	Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page, which would sleep for 5 seconds, then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.	Neutral
1177	Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?	Neutral
1180	Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.	Neutral
1184	On the client side, you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.	Neutral
1191	You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME, something like this.	Neutral
1193	Hope that helps.	Neutral
1199	to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).	Neutral
1205	Here it is.	Neutral
1206	Declare below string FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1208	This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.	Neutral
1212	or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.	Neutral
1221	You can try and do nothing about it.	Neutral
1224	( Come on, put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here, as suggested by @BaileyS. )	Neutral
1231	Only unchecked exception, compiler can skip to check.	Neutral
1240	There are 3 things you can do.	Neutral
1275	The short instruction is.	Neutral
1277	Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.	Neutral
1281	Suppose to have an FILE_NAME, say CODE_FRAGMENT, and two non-abstract subclasses, say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1283	E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
1284	which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.	Neutral
1285	Finally, if I try to deserialize as follows.	Neutral
1294	I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.	Neutral
1297	API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.	Neutral
743	Problem solved.	Positive
808	I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.	Positive
823	It will do the correct, ``legal ''stuff.	Positive
910	There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Positive
1011	But in the main case it works good enough.	Positive
1017	Stable and production ready lib.	Positive
1036	Not an extremely expensive operation I think.	Positive
1100	because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.	Positive
1102	This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.	Positive
1103	Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
1167	This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.	Positive
1171	They both seem to print out the list fine.	Positive
1320	Well a solution that works for me.	Positive
1223	That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).	Negative
1230	AS I know, it's impossible in the case.	Negative
1244	It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.	Negative
1255	You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ), by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).	Negative
1261	Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7.	Negative
1336	Your API_NAME is messed up and doesn't list dependencies properly.	Negative
1388	Without that information you have to start the debugging process by guessing.	Negative
1424	so I'm not happy with it.	Negative
1455	Connections, on the other hand, are expensive and need to be managed carefully by the application.	Negative
1504	i try to return an output ( type date ) in a web service but i receive a weird result.	Negative
1566	My previous code example used CODE_FRAGMENT to fuse the filter and map operations, but this was cumbersome and provided no advantage.	Negative
1613	At the moment I am receiving a ClassNotFoundException to API_NAME.	Negative
1617	I added it into my ANT_HOME / lib directory, but it didn't have any effect.	Negative
1622	It didn't make any difference, I receive the same error.	Negative
1663	An SQL EXCEPTION is being caught saying API_NAME: [ Microsoft ] [ ODBC Driver Manager ] Data source name not found and no default driver specified ''.	Negative
1763	If you've created your File IO and pulled from it in a weird way, you can corrupt the encoding of the key material.	Negative
1791	But the exception is occurring.	Negative

1310	Change the double quotationCODE_FRAGMENT to to a single quote CODE_FRAGMENT like this.	Neutral
1316	That said, you should be using prepared statements.	Neutral
1321	I have a project that is using Apache POI, and I made sure to include all the external JARs.	Neutral
1327	You will need to provide classpath in Jar file's manifest file.	Neutral
1328	See this official doc.	Neutral
1335	When the CODE_FRAGMENT command fails, it's almost always because of one of two things.	Neutral
1337	Make sure FILE_NAME dependencies in your manifest file point to jars, relative to FILE_NAME's parent directory.	Neutral
1339	Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1341	You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).	Neutral
1343	About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder, as you suggested, that's also possible.	Neutral
1344	Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1346	It simply adds all the.	Neutral
1347	jars within lib / folder to your classpath.	Neutral
1351	i have found out that i have to read the error log.	Neutral
1359	For testing I've created a.	Neutral

1377	How to fix it?	Neutral
1381	Look the documentation of InputStream #read ( byte [ ] b ).	Neutral
1385	You should always check the return values of functions for error conditions.	Neutral

1412	I'm considering making an Android app that integrates OData also.	Neutral
1414	I'm developing a mobile application.	Neutral
1422	I did some modification and in the end it was working, but it does not support odata functionallity ( queries like $filter, $oderby,... ) and for each request I need a new instance.	Neutral
1425	Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.	Neutral
1427	So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?	Neutral
1432	The mentioned components generate a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1442	If you want content, use the CODE_FRAGMENT element ( which isn't a void element ).	Neutral
1454	As long as your configuration doesn't change, you can create the Session once at the beginning and jsut keep using it.	Neutral
1472	I created a library project, exported it to a JAR file, and added to the build path of a couple of clients.	Neutral
1482	Important is that you use the right names for packages.	Neutral
1483	They should be unique!	Neutral
1490	I'm using netbeans for FILE_NAME coding.	Neutral
1491	Additionally, the CODE_FRAGMENT is never called.	Neutral
1492	Any pointer why this keeps happening.	Neutral
1513	FILE_NAME has a few abstract methods of its own.	Neutral
1518	CODE_FRAGMENT return an instance of type CODE_FRAGMENT which also CODE_FRAGMENT, but overrides some of the methods, including CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1531	Then I see, that criteriaBuilder don't have method createCriteriaUpdate.	Neutral
1532	Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?	Neutral
1533	You might have both JPA NUMBER and JPA NUMBER persistence jars on the classpath.	Neutral

1751	Once you have the CODE_FRAGMENT, you can get to the CODE_FRAGMENT and the public and private keys.	Neutral
1754	Something along the lines of.	Neutral
1767	You need an RSA key for encryption, maybe you can switch your signature algorithm to RSA/SHA1 to avoid the need for two keys.	Neutral
1769	You do not need to do anything special.	Neutral
1772	Can you do something like this were Java is FILE_NAME library.	Neutral
1779	How should I make it to get additional string input such as another user's id?	Neutral

1825	Any help appreciated.	Neutral
1835	You can then iterate through each departure element.	Neutral

1847	Sorry, should've added more.	Neutral
1848	keyboard is what I named the Scanner.	Neutral
1849	This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.	Neutral
1850	If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?	Neutral
1853	The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.	Neutral
1856	When the line is empty, it will return an empty string, CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1861	you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.	Neutral
1865	Here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1866	And here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1871	I've separated the loop body into two statements for clarity, but it's equivalent to.	Neutral
1876	Your fields should generally be private.	Neutral
1877	Add public ``getter ''methods where necessary.	Neutral

1882	And in your constructor, If you closeley look.	Neutral
1890	I want it to use id instead.	Neutral
1892	I have the same problem, I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.	Neutral
1895	then you will get CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1906	You need to inject LocalSessionFactoryBean into ObjectMapper.	Neutral

1931	Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.	Neutral
1942	If you see the source code of this method you will see that.	Neutral
1948	This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.	Neutral
1950	The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.	Neutral

2086	So, I thought I could create FILE_NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API_NAME code is in this answer.	Neutral
2088	So my Stream was finally.	Neutral
2094	The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.	Neutral
2097	Short answer.	Neutral
2101	I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.	Neutral
2102	Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2105	Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT, such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.	Neutral
2107	This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.	Neutral
2111	We want parallel treatment of our items.	Neutral
2114	More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.	Neutral

2164	Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2165	CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2168	If so, you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.	Neutral
2172	An CODE_FRAGMENT is.	Neutral
2174	I have a Unix command to send email.	Neutral
2178	Please guide me on this problem.	Neutral
2185	Well... no.	Neutral
2186	CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.	Neutral
2187	That is, it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.	Neutral
2190	It depends: which type of equality do you want?	Neutral
2194	Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2195	CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.	Neutral
2196	Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral

2217	Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?	Neutral
2220	From the articles I read, I kind of get the following.	Neutral
2226	for which you can specify the target directory.	Neutral
2228	If we move forward with this, this is what I envision.	Neutral
2229	If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.	Neutral
2240	2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.	Neutral

2269	Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.	Neutral
2270	Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.	Neutral
2272	Quite contrary, on Windows.	Neutral
2284	Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here, or.	Neutral
2287	It will read a byte each time here.	Neutral
2290	Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.	Neutral
2292	After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2293	and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.	Neutral
2295	On a sidenote.	Neutral
2312	CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.	Neutral
2315	This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).	Neutral
2322	Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding, use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.	Neutral
2323	Edit: - Missed to add one imp line, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2343	As to your point.	Neutral
2349	The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.	Neutral
2353	That shouldn't be an issue though.	Neutral
2363	It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.	Neutral
2365	Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.	Neutral
2366	You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.	Neutral
2380	And then for FILE_NAME we have.	Neutral

2423	I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.	Neutral
2425	And my Gradle File looks like this.	Neutral
2430	where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2432	If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.	Neutral
2433	So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.	Neutral
2435	I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.	Neutral
2437	InsertandRetriveBlobData.	Neutral
2456	Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.	Neutral
2461	You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.	Neutral
2463	Once you have a complete message, you need to process it.	Neutral
2470	Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage, current, temperature etc. ).	Neutral
2471	I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.	Neutral
2475	Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.	Neutral
2477	this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.	Neutral
1879	I suggest you to use.	Positive
1930	Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.	Positive
2137	This works for me.	Positive
2202	For me this worked.	Positive
2225	Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.	Positive
2231	It does its job, but was built for our use case.	Positive
2271	That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.	Positive
2364	I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.	Positive
2367	I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.	Positive
2396	So this works.	Positive
2545	In lieu of that, however, in my experience, ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity, flexibility, and ease-of-use.	Positive
2649	As others have already said, JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.	Positive
2669	There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.	Positive
2468	The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.	Negative

2872	I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.	Negative
2899	But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.	Negative
2928	This is an absurd, unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.	Negative
2938	First of all I do not think you need all these.	Negative
2480	So i created this from scratch.	Neutral
2482	and of course API_NAME.	Neutral
2490	it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.	Neutral
2493	What am I missing???	Neutral
2495	However, you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.	Neutral
2497	It's documentation can be found here.	Neutral
2506	a way to get FILE_NAME type, thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.	Neutral
2519	In a word: No.	Neutral

2579	Maybe you could do the same that he did, i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?	Neutral
2580	( see: this answer ).	Neutral
2583	how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?	Neutral
2602	There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.	Neutral
2604	I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.	Neutral
2605	How is blocking performed?	Neutral
2608	No, they don't use busy-waiting.	Neutral
2609	It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.	Neutral
2611	the exception is on line 72 and 114.	Neutral
2613	Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).	Neutral
2628	This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x, hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.	Neutral
2635	One which is the Pro full API.	Neutral
2637	I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.	Neutral
2641	When you build, you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus, artifactory, etc ), and then you would have 2 separate jars.	Neutral
2643	A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.	Neutral
2644	You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.	Neutral
2645	Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.	Neutral
2650	You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method, since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.	Neutral
2661	What I would like to do, take any random XML, and create object which will contain timestamps, integers, strings as well maps, basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure.	Neutral

2730	The API_NAME file code is.	Neutral
2732	When i run this API_NAME, their shows only the labels, and No button aor text field.	Neutral
2734	Wrong JSF tags.	Neutral
2741	In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).	Neutral
2744	Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2759	You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter/setter, so instead of.	Neutral
2762	Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2763	Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2765	Also to note, when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF/server/J2EE you are using ( without such information, we can not tell you which annotations you should use ).	Neutral
2770	Do i need to use event mechanism?	Neutral
2775	Use CODE_FRAGMENT instead, and get this string from a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2776	Check here for an example which returns a String.	Neutral
2777	Like this.	Neutral
2779	If you insist using CODE_FRAGMENT, you can try the below 2 ways.	Neutral
2786	Can anyone please help me out with this.	Neutral
2797	Hoping to get an alternate approach or a small overview of AnchorPane constraints.	Neutral
2798	Note: I'm new to JavaFX graphics library.	Neutral
2806	running CODE_FRAGMENT isn't enough, running CODE_FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me.	Neutral

2832	I created the simplest possible android app which starts the RegisterActivity generated by the plugin, where I did plug the ID, Api Key and project number.	Neutral
2833	I then click on the button but I get this error message.	Neutral
2834	Although, the console tells me that there is one instance up and running and the LOCAL_ANDROID_RUN variable in FILE_NAME is set to false.	Neutral
2836	How is that possible and what can I be doing wrong?	Neutral
2837	Thank you a lot in advance.	Neutral
2845	The same number is: 2.	Neutral
2855	Use this logic it will work for consecutive same values otherwise use ArrayList.	Neutral
2880	drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules.	Neutral
2881	What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java?	Neutral
2883	I don't know if this is the `accepted 'way, but with the following code I comine CODE_FRAGMENT files with programmatically created rules in Drools 6.	Neutral
2886	The following comment is found at the Java documentation.	Neutral
2896	Adding API_NAME ( ) after awaitTermination ( ) method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for.	Neutral
2897	I took help from this Question.	Neutral
2901	System prints data like this.	Neutral
2910	If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.	Neutral
2914	So, basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.	Neutral
2918	You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.	Neutral
2920	Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2921	It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.	Neutral
2922	UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII, two bytes for many europe languages.	Neutral
2923	Also each String object contains reference to char array.	Neutral
2926	So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2941	And then in your other file.	Neutral
2948	Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2951	But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the API_NAME.	Neutral
2959	In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.	Neutral
2963	I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.	Neutral
2983	Please see attached cause exception.	Neutral
2988	You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client, you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.	Neutral
2994	You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started.	Neutral
2995	Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here.	Neutral
2997	I am using Android Studio.	Neutral
3002	The logcat is as below.	Neutral
3003	Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?	Neutral
3007	FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.	Neutral
3015	My API_NAME seems to include the reference.	Neutral
3020	Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3029	As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,.	Neutral
3031	I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.	Neutral
3032	I have also tried to use.	Neutral
3037	( In this case I would have used.	Neutral
3050	Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.	Neutral
3055	so, how we can parse above like example expression easier, or FILE_NAME api for string parser.	Neutral
3076	This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
3080	Now I want this, when the user check a shipper by EditTextView, I have from database an Object.	Neutral
3081	I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.	Neutral
3082	Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.	Neutral
3084	So instead of setting Bundle to null, you can do something like this.	Neutral
3085	Check out this link for more info.	Neutral
3099	I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call,.	Neutral
3106	This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.	Neutral
2761	Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.	Positive
2805	Solved, in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.	Positive
2904	Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.	Positive
2907	This solution is more flexible.	Positive
2940	but if you want you can do this.	Positive
2942	I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.	Positive
2953	With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.	Positive
3173	There are many ways to solve it, the simplest is call.	Positive
3185	The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.	Positive
3226	You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.	Positive
3337	Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT, useful for quantifier syntax.	Positive
3404	The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3427	In any case, manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.	Positive
2958	This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.	Negative
2965	But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.	Negative
2971	then I gets the module error again from JNA.	Negative
2999	This line gives the error.	Negative
3024	I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.	Negative
3132	And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
3134	But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.	Negative
3172	You have problem with classpath.	Negative
3186	Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.	Negative
3214	I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.	Negative
3244	If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.	Negative
3287	does not work without previously setting the FILE_NAME.	Negative
3366	They all fail with the following error.	Negative
3382	The following is the error I keep getting.	Negative
3396	But it isn't working like I expected.	Negative
3398	But unexpectedly, I am getting 66.	Negative
3430	As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.	Negative
3569	Why is it reading it wrongly?	Negative
3107	I'm new to FILE_NAME language.	Neutral
3126	In Java, you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.	Neutral
3135	Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. )	Neutral
3145	If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java, use a FILE_NAME.	Neutral
3163	So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3193	When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.	Neutral
3212	I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.	Neutral
3224	Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it, loop through it, create a Comparator etc..	Neutral
3232	I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.	Neutral
3238	You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.	Neutral
3250	I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.	Neutral
3256	The program is just a hello world Program.	Neutral
3267	You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.	Neutral
3269	CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.	Neutral
3282	( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes, though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. )	Neutral
3288	Finally, ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.	Neutral
3290	So you can do.	Neutral
3294	One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.	Neutral
3300	The code in Java is.	Neutral
3302	What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.	Neutral
3321	This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.	Neutral
3322	Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3323	Are they equivalent?	Neutral
3340	I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.	Neutral
3341	They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3346	I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.	Neutral
3352	So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.	Neutral
3359	Try to download *.	Neutral
3361	May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.	Neutral
3368	Let me know if there are any other details that might help!	Neutral
3370	Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3372	Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.	Neutral
3389	Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).	Neutral
3393	For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3395	I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.	Neutral
3407	If you want to print a int as binary, use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.	Neutral
3409	Version of Spring is NUMBER.	Neutral
3410	I have a session bean, declared as.	Neutral
3413	After debugging, i found out, that when test spring context is started, in the.	Neutral
3422	You can add a util method to your test, something like.	Neutral
3426	In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3429	See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.	Neutral
3432	However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.	Neutral
3435	Obviously, the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT, but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT, etc..	Neutral

3445	And DispatherConfig is this.	Neutral
3446	Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.	Neutral
3448	hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.	Neutral
3453	Let's put your code inside a method.	Neutral
3454	If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.	Neutral
3457	If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.	Neutral
3462	The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp, which access the Oracle database.	Neutral
3463	This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.	Neutral
3464	Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?	Neutral
3468	Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java, see if this works for you.	Neutral
3469	Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.	Neutral
3472	When I run this on Windows, the console tells me.	Neutral
3484	Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?	Neutral
3487	Note, however, it's called CODE_FRAGMENT, with a capital D.	Neutral
3492	Question 2: From the javadoc.	Neutral
3493	So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.	Neutral
3502	But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3510	What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.	Neutral
3514	Something like below,.	Neutral
3524	Hope it clarifies.	Neutral
3539	I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.	Neutral
3548	Which outputs.	Neutral
3553	I have a string like this.	Neutral
3554	Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.	Neutral
3556	url WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3557	is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?	Neutral
3564	I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.	Neutral
3568	And I got the output like this.	Neutral
3577	mm stands for minutes.	Neutral
3584	So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.	Neutral
3589	Accourding to this answer.	Neutral
3592	IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.	Neutral
3596	and call the client as follows.	Neutral
3598	The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.	Neutral
3599	API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.	Neutral
3600	Please see the following sample code.	Neutral
3605	en-dash & em-dash word count differs from MS-Office.	Neutral
3616	Hi I have a sample log file here.	Neutral
3630	The API_NAME ( String regex,.	Neutral
3632	You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.	Neutral
3634	The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.	Neutral
3656	To stop this runnable, you have to call this when needed.	Neutral
3661	And a string contains the name of the enum.	Neutral
3665	You have to do it like this.	Neutral
3666	Here's an alternative way.	Neutral
3669	Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.	Neutral
3683	Here is the actual data sent.	Neutral
3703	I think you also have to look at the database configuration.	Neutral
3709	The package gets deleted in the registry.	Neutral
3719	install4j transforms entered package names to path names, so ''.''	Neutral
3730	Using FILE_NAME I can do something like this.	Neutral
3737	Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated.	Neutral
3739	If call is successful, the onResponse ( ) method is called.	Neutral
3740	If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.	Neutral
3743	I'm trying to inject a DAO using @Autowire.	Neutral
3750	Any advice is welcome.	Neutral
3752	FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).	Neutral
3753	Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.	Neutral
3755	You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.	Neutral
3758	In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?	Neutral
3759	I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work, scope wise.	Neutral
3761	I am curious about the problem I have proposed.	Neutral
3768	Thank you in advance!	Neutral
3772	That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.	Neutral
3780	But, i didn't give me the thing i need!	Neutral
3781	How can i do that?	Neutral
3785	Since CODE_FRAGMENT is a meta character, and it's have a special meaning in regex.	Neutral
3788	What method should I use to update existing ldap objects?	Neutral
3790	Person repo interface.	Neutral
3797	I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.	Neutral
3811	What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?	Neutral
3824	You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.	Neutral
3844	If so, then how far does this go; for example, could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?	Neutral
3847	I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.	Neutral
3480	The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.	Positive
3547	The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.	Positive
3560	It seems, after a quick google search, that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3562	This might prove to be useful unbescape.	Positive
3635	Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length, the simplest solution is.	Positive
3922	There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.	Positive
3941	Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.	Positive
4055	That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.	Positive
4126	And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.	Positive
4261	Ok, I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).	Positive
4423	Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.	Positive
4570	That's correct behavior.	Positive
4651	I finally managed to get it to work.	Positive
3622	The error is as shown below.	Negative
3623	Exception in thread ``main`` API_NAME: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type.	Negative
3639	I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.	Negative
3679	The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.	Negative
3681	I tried the following and it returns nothing.	Negative
3798	I searched a lot but i not found any solution.	Negative
3842	What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?	Negative
3848	When I tried to compile the tool, I get n error.	Negative
3853	I don't know what else to do to make things to work.	Negative
3897	I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.	Negative
3927	I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ), but it is not displaying.	Negative
3935	I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT, but there is none.	Negative
3965	but still nothing.	Negative
4040	But it's not necessary for our case.	Negative
4079	Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.	Negative
4109	I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.	Negative
4141	I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.	Negative
4149	I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.	Negative
3851	I also have set JAVA_HOME.	Neutral
3855	Use full path in ANT_HOME, eg.	Neutral
3856	It dependes where it is exactly located.	Neutral
3865	Thanks and Greeting!	Neutral
3872	So the question is.	Neutral
3887	If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ), they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.	Neutral
3888	This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.	Neutral
3894	try this type code.	Neutral
3899	In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.	Neutral
3901	and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).	Neutral
3905	If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.	Neutral
3907	If you need to shorten the button code, Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.	Neutral
3909	Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.	Neutral
3915	You can use syntax like.	Neutral
3916	I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.	Neutral
3919	In your code, you need to replace.	Neutral
3920	Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.	Neutral
3921	Which creates the file writer in append mode, see the docs here.	Neutral
3928	Here is a MacOSX MenuBar.	Neutral
3929	Below is my code.	Neutral
3931	I am running the program as a Java Application.	Neutral
3937	Some technical details.	Neutral
3938	I am using Java SE version NUMBER.	Neutral
3939	My computer's OS is Mac OS X NUMBER.	Neutral
3948	You can see in the code above I use this to call my bean in the other proyect.	Neutral
3950	I also tried using this.	Neutral
3959	Wildfly Developer Guide.	Neutral
3963	The code i am using is.	Neutral
3966	Assume you have this directory layout.	Neutral
3983	What's happening?	Neutral
3992	I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.	Neutral
3993	It started about a month ago, after a deployment.	Neutral
4001	CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.	Neutral
4004	As part of GC, first minor GC is triggered.	Neutral
4007	I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?	Neutral
4013	So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.	Neutral
4018	You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4020	Also, based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject, the unit is milliseconds, not seconds.	Neutral
4021	Try these longer term things in the long term.	Neutral
4022	If you can, try the G1GC collector.	Neutral
4023	You are using Java 7, so if you can in your current environment, give it a try.	Neutral
4024	It's meant for performance with big heaps.	Neutral
4030	Remember, the bigger the heap, the longer the garbage collector takes, irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.	Neutral
4031	You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.	Neutral
4038	Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.	Neutral
4043	At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4046	You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints, and still receive compile-time verification.	Neutral
4047	One way would be.	Neutral
4050	FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.	Neutral
4052	( If you're not using Java 8, it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one, and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )	Neutral
4054	You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4060	Thanks alot!	Neutral
4062	So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name, not price, the 2nd will changed as well, but not the opposite!	Neutral
4064	Runnable example ( adapted from answer to your previous question ).	Neutral
4066	I want update text by line number,.	Neutral
4067	for E.g. I want to change text in number 2 into.	Neutral
4070	I have to implement gtalk like chat application using UDP FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4075	Check TextSamplerDemo.	Neutral
4078	Chat window using JTextPane no images though.	Neutral
4082	The unicode for white smiling face is\ u263A.	Neutral
4088	Adding API_NAME-api-API_NAME resolved my NoClassDefFoundError.	Neutral
4089	FILE_NAME does not get listed in the maven dependency tree.	Neutral
4107	iml file if anyone is curious how Intellij is viewing this module.	Neutral
4108	I develop Cursive.	Neutral
4130	NUMBER mapping-file, FILE_NAME-file, FILE_NAME, exclude-unlisted-classes.	Neutral
4132	So I obtained the following project structure.	Neutral
4133	I modified the ``API_NAME ''file.	Neutral
4168	safety and scope beans to current thread.	Neutral
4172	As you can see some of the code is generated at runtime in methods by CGLib enhancer.	Neutral
4175	Any suggestions or interesting links appreciated!	Neutral
4178	And all injections occurs just once - on application starting.	Neutral
4182	Let's find out, how scoped beans do work.	Neutral
4189	Now, about scoped proxies.	Neutral
4191	This means, that every time you will operate on the exact same object, that was originally injected on start.	Neutral
4194	To do it, as said in documentation, declare you bean as proxified.	Neutral
4197	CODE_FRAGMENT working almost same way.	Neutral
4204	The text file has 10 lines of data and each line contains a piece of data in the format of: ``Integer1-String1: String2 ''example:`` 123-ABC: DEFG''.	Neutral
4212	You might want to create a FILE_NAME for your data.	Neutral
4224	Obtain the raw lines and keep them in a ( Clojure ) lazy sequence.	Neutral
4247	On the right side of notification android is showing time.	Neutral
4252	Refer more than here: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
4257	Currently, I create the index like so.	Neutral
4260	Any help will be greatly appreciated.	Neutral
4263	Create your index like so.	Neutral
4264	And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.	Neutral
4266	To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.	Neutral
4274	Why not?	Neutral
4277	What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.	Neutral
4278	It isn't, not at least at JPA level.	Neutral
4283	This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.	Neutral
4284	( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).	Neutral
4292	Currently, I have a method.	Neutral
4293	The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.	Neutral
4307	CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).	Neutral
4310	There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory, so you're done.	Neutral
4313	All of that can just go.	Neutral
4327	I have set up the Interface as follows.	Neutral
4330	where mOut is an ActivityInterface.	Neutral
4332	If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4341	Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.	Neutral
4353	That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int, int ) can not be referenced from a static context '', because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.	Neutral
4358	Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.	Neutral
4362	I inject the beans with AutowireHelper.	Neutral
4378	Recently, I tried to implement the AppBarLayout with tabs.	Neutral
4380	I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4382	And here is the result in an emulator.	Neutral
4385	Here is the XML layout.	Neutral
4386	There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.	Neutral
4387	WEB_ADDRESS #UNWRAP_ROOT_VALUE - see FILE_NAME #WRAP_ROOT_VALUE as well.	Neutral
4389	Config example for spring is available at.	Neutral
4391	I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.	Neutral
4395	How do I achieve this?	Neutral
4398	Is there a configuration for Jackson/Spring that I am missing?	Neutral
4400	The complete error message is.	Neutral
4401	Just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4403	I tried below code and I got this output.	Neutral
4409	HashSet ( Java Platform SE 8 ) says.	Neutral
4413	We have a requirement to show only -LCB- RED, BLUE -RCB- in a certain user interface?	Neutral
4415	see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4652	Thank you dunni for your help, you've put me on the right path.	Positive
4654	And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.	Positive
4710	but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.	Positive
4711	Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.	Positive
4737	FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.	Positive
4847	This answer describes what is happening more clearly.	Positive
4853	For example, the following works great.	Positive
4897	It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.	Positive
4982	Comparison time should be fast, so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.	Positive
5005	Congratulations.	Positive
5007	Databases are much better at handling data than Java.	Positive
5008	Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster, with less CPU, less memory and less network traffic.	Positive
5015	Embrace the Joy of Sets!	Positive
4167	I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib, but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.	Negative
4275	This is your problem.	Negative
4295	This is not my intention.	Negative
4333	I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.	Negative
4551	This isn't valid Java.	Negative
4578	Well, the funny part is, we do not know.	Negative
4596	The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.	Negative
4636	This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.	Negative
4637	The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4645	I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.	Negative
4698	The problem is that you wrote.	Negative
4775	I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4812	I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4813	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.	Negative
4841	CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.	Negative
4861	Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.	Negative
4869	I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.	Negative
4940	Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.	Negative
4420	See from Javadocs of String #compareTo.	Neutral
4422	I have a service which writes input stream to a file.	Neutral
4426	FILE_NAME: 30 line is basically CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4429	As I read more into the article, I see that there is an API that looks like this.	Neutral
4430	If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).	Neutral
4431	Would I in theory, be able to send a notification with whatever information I want to that device?	Neutral
4442	If you use the XMPP protocol.	Neutral
4443	You should implement a connection server that manages the connection to FCM to handle upstream and downstream messages.	Neutral
4453	Applet and JSP Communication.	Neutral
4454	I have tomcat hosting my website FILE_NAME api for database management.	Neutral
4458	Anyone have any idea on the problem?	Neutral
4462	I know the question is very broad but please help me thanks.	Neutral
4469	You can read more about it here.	Neutral
4470	i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.	Neutral
4477	Either pass 4 digit year or fix your pattern.	Neutral
4478	Maybe i found a solution to your problem.	Neutral
4485	Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core, tomcat-embed-websocket, tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )	Neutral
4489	Thanks in advance!	Neutral
4490	I am writing a cloud-sync application in Java with.	Neutral
4496	P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.	Neutral
4498	Thank you for any hint.	Neutral
4499	I just found a solution for Java NUMBER + in combination with native and jni dlls.	Neutral
4507	In my CODE_FRAGMENT script I have.	Neutral
4508	The repository description on MVNrepository lists several compile dependencies, including Selenium-Chrome-Driver, Selenium-FirefoSMILE_FACEriver, etc..	Neutral
4513	The image below shows that it's being compiled from the Maven script.	Neutral
4516	So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver, you need to.	Neutral
4522	How to do that is explained here.	Neutral
4527	You don't have to base64-encode the access token before use.	Neutral
4532	Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.	Neutral
4544	Concept of atomicity comes when something is mutable.	Neutral
4556	The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.	Neutral
4568	When you add 3 hours, you will get March 30, 2010 02:00 UTC.	Neutral
4572	Precisely at March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC, so March 30, 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30, 2010: 01:59 CEST, but March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30, 2010 03:00 CEST.	Neutral
4575	In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.	Neutral
4580	That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying, otherwise you risk an ambiguity.	Neutral
4583	Here is an example ( please, note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).	Neutral
4588	When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!	Neutral
4590	Where is my mistake?	Neutral
4600	I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.	Neutral
4602	You might do something like this.	Neutral
4613	Omitted time zone.	Neutral
4615	Should have been translated to UTC time.	Neutral
4619	Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4620	No Midnight.	Neutral
4624	Some comments about this source code.	Neutral
4626	Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.	Neutral
4647	EAR dependencies.	Neutral
4648	The datasource should load from jndi, this is my API_NAME.	Neutral
4653	And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4659	i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.	Neutral
4666	You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.	Neutral
4671	I want to ask some questions.	Neutral
4677	( My question is here, how to list the music on JScrollPane?? )	Neutral
4679	If i double click each music ( sample1, sample2 ), the music that I choose is playing.	Neutral
4682	I want the music's name that I choose.	Neutral
4684	like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )	Neutral
4689	I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4699	But you should have written.	Neutral
4700	I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7,.	Neutral
4701	I can send POST request with this code.	Neutral
4713	Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.	Neutral
4714	startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusive.	Neutral
4717	To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.	Neutral
4726	Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.	Neutral
4727	This is a list in python.	Neutral
4728	This is how the slice operator would work.	Neutral
4746	OutputRaw solve me issue.	Neutral
4747	I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).	Neutral
4749	Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..	Neutral
4752	So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4761	The output that I get is -.	Neutral
4770	The statement should have been.	Neutral
4779	Here is what I have now.	Neutral
4780	Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!	Neutral
4783	ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).	Neutral
4788	That said, you have a couple options.	Neutral
4789	You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.	Neutral
4793	This would look like.	Neutral
4795	I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.	Neutral
4796	Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.	Neutral
4814	Just delete the method.	Neutral
4815	CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.	Neutral
4817	Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4823	Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).	Neutral
4826	I cant use Date format,, only string.	Neutral
4835	Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).	Neutral
4842	But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.	Neutral
4843	More details in thread.	Neutral
4848	In my case, I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.	Neutral
4859	The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.	Neutral
4863	Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.	Neutral
4865	can not be cast to API_NAME.	Neutral
4873	The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.	Neutral
4874	---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.	Neutral
4875	I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here, such as Velocity and FreeMarker.	Neutral
4883	The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).	Neutral
4885	I have 2D closed vector paths, specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.	Neutral
4905	I expect to do a system when you can do a survey, and then, press a button, open a new activity and see survey answers.	Neutral
4908	Here is my code of the survey, XML and JAVA.	Neutral
4913	like this just capture all user input data, No need for the database in this.	Neutral
4914	Here list is the list of all question you are having....	Neutral
4916	getQuestion and similarly with answer.	Neutral
4918	I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.	Neutral
4924	In this situation, when I click on the greyed out widget, I need to start the app.	Neutral
4926	how I could achieve this.	Neutral
4930	You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4948	Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.	Neutral
4949	Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT, because the latter only processes public fields.	Neutral
4953	Let's assume my model looks like this.	Neutral
4957	I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.	Neutral
4961	Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.	Neutral
4966	Plese guide.	Neutral
4967	Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required, NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).	Neutral
4968	Targetting to achieve.	Neutral
4969	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string, e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4970	If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.	Neutral
4984	New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.	Neutral
4990	Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4996	Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.	Neutral
5026	I understand the boolean expression here.	Positive
5052	If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way, try CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5073	This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.	Positive
5244	Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.	Positive
5262	it's worth a shot.	Positive
5324	I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.	Positive
5381	It's really good.	Positive
5382	It's an excellent, fast library.	Positive
5408	At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.	Positive
5497	check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.	Positive
5518	This works fine.	Positive
5600	It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5626	The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.	Positive
4942	Because it's not initialized yet.	Negative
4945	( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
4947	I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT, but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.	Negative
5101	Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.	Negative
5128	Data loss.	Negative
5219	When I run the project, I get the following error,.	Negative
5256	As you can see, the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering, it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.	Negative
5307	As others have stated, this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.	Negative
5310	We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.	Negative
5364	All seems OK, but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).	Negative
5385	... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.	Negative
5409	I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
5478	( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )	Negative
5542	It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.	Negative
5567	I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5607	Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work, unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.	Negative
5623	There is a caveat with the above approach.	Negative
5636	It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.	Negative
5003	Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT, iterating the submap, giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.	Neutral
5016	Hmmm.	Neutral
5027	But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?	Neutral
5030	So you can see, since CODE_FRAGMENT, exception is not thrown.	Neutral
5034	Can you help in understanding this code.	Neutral
5035	Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.	Neutral
5056	In the code you referenced, readLine is called on a BufferedReader.	Neutral
5061	An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.	Neutral
5063	The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.	Neutral
5071	In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.	Neutral
5078	Here's an example of a JSON structure.	Neutral
5079	Here it's the function that parses the json.	Neutral
5082	I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic, I don't always know what structure will come from it.	Neutral
5087	Can I use a recursive function?	Neutral
5093	Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.	Neutral
5113	Consider the following interface.	Neutral
5114	Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.	Neutral
5115	Now consider the following FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5122	Avoid legacy date-time classes.	Neutral
5129	The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.	Neutral
5133	Instead, use API_NAME classes.	Neutral
5135	When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT, immediately convert to API_NAME types.	Neutral
5137	In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7, use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5138	An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
5141	API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.	Neutral
5144	To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial.	Neutral
5146	Specification is JSR 310.	Neutral
5161	Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?	Neutral
5165	Use it.	Neutral
5168	You probably mean.	Neutral
5172	e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5173	I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.	Neutral
5174	The regex is.	Neutral
5176	I am using this.	Neutral
5184	You can use this regex.	Neutral
5185	You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.	Neutral
5196	If so, please show an example.	Neutral
5203	What is best practice while testing Android Services?	Neutral
5208	After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process, following the instructions from here, I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.	Neutral
5218	I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below,.	Neutral
5220	I took several measures,.	Neutral
5223	What should I do to solve the issue?	Neutral
5225	I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.	Neutral
5233	How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?	Neutral
5257	Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?	Neutral
5258	Graphics Initialization.	Neutral
5260	I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.	Neutral
5267	See here.	Neutral
5275	url: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5284	I've given an example below.	Neutral
5293	There are several options.	Neutral
5295	Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.	Neutral
5317	Since that time we've tended more toward option two.	Neutral
5322	I will post it here if I find anything new.	Neutral
5325	But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.	Neutral
5333	you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.	Neutral
5339	and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.	Neutral
5342	There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.	Neutral
5344	This is especially true for long lived callbacks.	Neutral
5347	Otherwise, it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.	Neutral
5359	Here is the code that does the push.	Neutral
5365	Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).	Neutral
5370	For the records, I found it ;o).	Neutral
5372	For deails see Adobe forums thread.	Neutral
5374	Enjoy and thank you for your time!	Neutral
5378	FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.	Neutral
5392	Or simply use Maven repository.	Neutral
5394	Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.	Neutral
5395	Add other jars from your JDK.	Neutral
5397	All projects will see the changed JRE definition.	Neutral
5437	See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.	Neutral
5438	( And please reformat your code ).	Neutral
5446	The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.	Neutral
5448	The customer leaves the salon.	Neutral
5450	If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.	Neutral
5454	I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.	Neutral
5463	You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.	Neutral
5464	As long as the customer does not enter the saloon, it holds NotSleeping.	Neutral
5480	Here's an example.	Neutral
5484	In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.	Neutral
5489	Use FILE_NAME instead of float.	Neutral
5490	And use Java code like this.	Neutral
5491	I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5498	If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.	Neutral
5500	For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
5505	How can i solve it.	Neutral
5509	Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it, the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5512	Well, you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5517	You have to new it up.	Neutral
5519	Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT, this will help.	Neutral
5523	I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.	Neutral
5525	The FILE_NAME looks like this.	Neutral
5537	Check if your Table has that style bit.	Neutral
5539	I added.	Neutral
5548	Here is an example in Java.	Neutral
5551	To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5552	Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.	Neutral
5559	After the request is done, all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.	Neutral
5561	The output looks like this.	Neutral
5563	When that is ready I shall post the code.	Neutral
5565	An usage example.	Neutral
5582	While I would expect.	Neutral
5593	To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.	Neutral
5613	Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.	Neutral
5615	In a similar manner, you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.	Neutral
5635	my beans are destroyed, How on startup I can get the same bean registered.	Neutral
5637	As of JUnit there shouldnt be a dependency for your build, right?	Neutral
5640	I Add Junit >> > right click on project - > properties - > Java Build Path - > libraries - > add library.	Neutral
5643	Warning is -.	Neutral
5653	My code follows.	Neutral
5657	Use the SVN Kit library instead.	Neutral
5683	So in other words, it would be a bug to recieve a non workday in this example.	Neutral
5684	Store the valid strings in a CODE_FRAGMENT, and decide whether a string is a valid day or not based on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5692	Let me know if you need more details.	Neutral
5700	I know its an old post, but I believe following result will be still interesting.	Neutral
5702	The table below shows time required by simple loop and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5708	I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.	Neutral
5720	May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?	Neutral
5724	I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.	Neutral
5658	Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.	Positive
5668	But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.	Positive
5671	I still think it's not the best design, but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.	Positive
5680	Or since in NUMBER% of cases, day will be correct.	Positive
5685	The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.	Positive
5694	Even in your own parsing approach, you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.	Positive
5707	This should almost be obvious.	Positive
5731	The application is complete and working fine.	Positive
5792	And this code worked.	Positive
5867	Working Configuration.	Positive
5903	There is a solution to your problem.	Positive
5916	This configuration works very well.	Positive
5924	( Hopefully with a good example. )	Positive
5649	If I run the code in the GUI, it just hangs.	Negative
5655	I have looked and found that there are some packages that would automatically enter my keyring on login but that isn't really an option.	Negative
5670	When I first saw it, I was horrified.	Negative
5718	Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve, though.	Negative
5791	This code failed.	Negative
5803	You can not supply system properties to the API_NAME tool, unfortunately.	Negative
5812	I have found out that certain misconfigured servers send an ``Unrecognized Name ''warning in the SSL handshake which is ignored by most clients... except for Java.	Negative
5878	You can't open CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5887	This is an issue with how volley handles HTTPUrlConnection and retry policy.	Negative
5964	So it's basically in the wrong form.	Negative
5996	Avoid them.	Negative
6114	This may or may not work.	Negative
6309	On Facebook i ran in to a problem.	Negative
6316	The result was the same that i don't have the correct permissions.	Negative
6326	I am new to this so maybe i'm doing somthing wrong.	Negative
6329	And now my app is getting it's app Token and i can use it to publish messages but the problem is those messages can not be viewed on the app page it self.	Negative
6378	There's no way to do that, AFAIK.	Negative
6385	You can't suspend a thread like that.	Negative
5726	There is a dynamic templating component that is moving from the tapx component library to core Tapestry in NUMBER.	Neutral
5728	Here is a brief description of it.	Neutral
5732	A small description of application is as follow.	Neutral
5733	The application is basically an object manager, where user add new object, remove old objects and connect object with each other.	Neutral
5738	What Left.	Neutral
5744	cricle and fill that with red.	Neutral
5752	However, I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..	Neutral
5753	Using this you'd basically only have to define your object graph.	Neutral
5761	can someone help me how to do this with a piece of code.	Neutral
5777	Thanks in advance to everyone.	Neutral
5779	You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.	Neutral
5780	This website shows how.	Neutral
5789	I had what I believe the same issue is.	Neutral
5790	I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.	Neutral
5795	Was being sent from the server to the client.	Neutral
5801	If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).	Neutral
5806	UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.	Neutral
5815	To allow your programs to work without re-compiling, run your app as.	Neutral
5827	When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ), retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT, but this time without a host name.	Neutral
5842	Alarmingly, my customer has discovered a setting in the Java control panel which resolves this.	Neutral
5849	Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.	Neutral
5862	Restart your Tomcat ( important ).	Neutral
5863	Just to add a solution here.	Neutral
5868	My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.	Neutral
5877	The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.	Neutral
5880	Btw, you can also try apache http components.	Neutral
5900	You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.	Neutral
5905	here is an example hot to use countdownlatch.	Neutral
5908	If you have access to the configuration of your EJB container and you can set the executor, then you could Guava's addCallback method.	Neutral
5911	Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService, so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.	Neutral
5915	I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.	Neutral
5933	Basically, the component type is mandatory for JSF in order to create the component by CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
5936	The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5944	tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.	Neutral
5951	I have just a quick question: Are files created before they are finished, or are they finished and then created?	Neutral
5966	How do I get this string into the form of a JSONArray so that I can access it's elements.	Neutral
5971	I'm printing a String.	Neutral
5977	In the below code, a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.	Neutral
5978	So, the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.	Neutral
5983	The book time should be from 20:00 -6:00.	Neutral
5984	whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.	Neutral
6001	The length of the appointments, the span of time not yet attached to the timeline, should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6004	Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT, FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.	Neutral
6007	For example, 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN, and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.	Neutral
6008	You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.	Neutral
6018	CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.	Neutral
6024	When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time, combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6030	Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.	Neutral
6031	Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.	Neutral
6032	We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.	Neutral
6036	The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
6038	Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.	Neutral
6040	We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
6048	The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration API_NAME.	Neutral
6057	Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?	Neutral
6059	With CODE_FRAGMENT, this example took NUMBER seconds with the option on and NUMBER second with it off in Java 6 update 29.	Neutral
6064	( Should be visible in a couple of days ).	Neutral
6067	It seems Oracle really removed the option.	Neutral

6203	Jar file check following link.	Neutral
6205	Hope it will help you.	Neutral
6218	So what do you think?	Neutral
6221	Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.	Neutral
6222	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6224	Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.	Neutral
6225	It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.	Neutral
6229	Since this is homework, here's some hints.	Neutral
6236	To clarify, a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.	Neutral
6240	Let's look at a sample call.	Neutral
6248	You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!	Neutral
6254	and finally here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
6273	Assuming instance variables, frst way, EC, CC, PT are ZERO.	Neutral
6280	CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.	Neutral
6289	No, it's not the same.	Neutral
6294	only HC will be initialized.	Neutral
6295	all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).	Neutral
6298	You can also do it as follows.	Neutral
6299	First declare all variables.	Neutral
6300	Then assign value.	Neutral
6302	If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC, CC, PT and HC values are one.	Neutral

6330	I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.	Neutral
6331	Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?	Neutral
6340	#NAME?	Neutral
6347	I tried something like this.	Neutral
6348	The result was byte [ ].	Neutral
6356	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.	Neutral
6358	As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.	Neutral
6361	Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components, and the progress bar can be customized.	Neutral
6363	Say, after several text appended to a text area, I want this to be appended.	Neutral
6364	``Please wait, a download is in progress ''.	Neutral
6365	After that a download progress status with progress meter character '#' gets appended.	Neutral
5927	The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.	Positive
5990	Also, JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler.	Positive
6077	The option reduces heap usage.	Positive
6080	For workloads that are memory capacity constrained ( i.e. have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time ), this option can prove useful.	Positive
6089	CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example, instead of copying.	Positive
6094	With the new design, they could also support other encodings in future.	Positive
6102	API_NAME can be used.	Positive
6106	Here's a good example from Jetty's wiki page WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
6144	Using consistent indentation and sensible whitespace can make your code much easier to read.	Positive
6184	Very good example of steady pooling readHere.	Positive
6238	Now we're getting to the good part.	Positive
6308	So far i've done this for Twitter and it works very well.	Positive
6328	I solved the earlier problem.	Positive
6359	Addendum: CODE_FRAGMENT is useful for managing lengthy background tasks while displaying interim progress.	Positive
6	But sadly this is not working.	Negative
78	So, everything builds fine, but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.	Negative
90	That is what is causing your null pointer exception.	Negative
139	All attempts I've made were, in a shortcut, unsuccessful.	Negative
162	Don't use.	Negative
187	However when I try to run FILE_NAME, it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.	Negative
200	Problem: without zooming, the added content doesn't get visible.	Negative
201	in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size, but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.	Negative
256	else your GUI will be Hanged.	Negative
342	I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast.	Negative
361	But the above code doesn't work outside the ``FILE_NAME JavaAgent`` FILE_NAME of the main Agent.	Negative
436	Please note there is a bug in FILE_NAME, L996 +997.	Negative
444	I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.	Negative
448	the problem is the following.	Negative
491	When I run my client, it throws the following exception.	Negative
521	i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.	Negative
526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral
181	I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.	Neutral
183	resources/API _ NAME creation option: package required library into FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
191	While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system, most other applications can not.	Neutral
196	Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.	Neutral
204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
580	This is the first time I've encountered something like below.	Negative
583	NOT WORKING: directly compiled the src on Unix machine and used FILE_NAME files.	Negative
587	For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.	Negative
617	It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.	Negative
619	Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.	Negative
653	Eclipse error: `Failed to create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Negative
726	But unfortunately it can not be used!!!	Negative
832	Maybe there are some problems with the path of the file ( on my pc )!?!?	Negative
855	... but no such thing exists.	Negative
892	After entering the details, when the button is clicked, the entered data must be displayed as shown below, but I am not sure how to align it.	Negative
940	But the file output messes with the chinese characters.	Negative
964	Not related.	Negative
965	Not even sure what JSR that is.	Negative
994	I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.	Negative
1027	I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).	Negative
1079	I wanted to see all the files I have in my external storage, I have this library that display the text to the user, but when I'm using it to show the sub files, it says something like.	Negative
1152	A workaround might be to use reflection, however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness, performance problems, breaking encapsulation, etc ).	Negative
648	This should read all files in the single input directory.	Neutral
650	It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.	Neutral
658	Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.	Neutral
663	Another option may be the Factory pattern.	Neutral
665	Of course you can combine both.	Neutral
672	You could use a kind of strategy.	Neutral
681	This way, you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.	Neutral
685	Hope it helps.	Neutral
689	You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.	Neutral
691	In some cases there is a trade that you need to do, thus you should take into account your project's requirements.	Neutral
698	Tried just to see the response.	Neutral
706	I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.	Neutral
713	I have downloaded a few Android applications from Google Play.	Neutral
714	I have got CODE_FRAGMENT code through reverse engineering tool CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
717	Is there any way to generate call graphs automatically?	Neutral
727	thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby, which can be found in here.	Neutral
731	and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.	Neutral
734	Do you have any hints to avoid this error?	Neutral
739	Thank you!	Neutral
740	Gotcha!	Neutral
744	The full story here!	Neutral
764	So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.	Neutral
778	I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.	Neutral
779	I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).	Neutral
784	The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.	Neutral
794	In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.	Neutral
810	Find out more.	Neutral
816	How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? )	Neutral
819	Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC, with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.	Neutral
822	Trust URI.	Neutral
833	CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes, they are sent in separate chunk of the request.	Neutral
838	Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.	Neutral
841	Use FileUtils from Apache commons.	Neutral
842	Using you current code, make this tweak.	Neutral
849	You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.	Neutral
858	I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
866	What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
870	CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs, not CODE_FRAGMENTs.	Neutral
877	I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.	Neutral
879	Thanks in advance.	Neutral
882	FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.	Neutral
883	What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.	Neutral
886	You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.	Neutral
888	This example compiles and runs.	Neutral
893	This is what I have so far.	Neutral
895	Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.	Neutral
897	Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.	Neutral
898	Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.	Neutral
903	Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?	Neutral
907	I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.	Neutral
911	In a word, no.	Neutral
913	I've a program test to see if the user input is a positive number and an integer.	Neutral
921	Try this.	Neutral
924	Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.	Neutral
934	convert PDF to SVG characters with font, size, x/y, etc. ( PDFBox does this ).	Neutral
937	attempt to interpret the areas as cells of rectangular tables.	Neutral
944	Something like this.	Neutral
945	The answer from @hyde is valid, but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.	Neutral
946	Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.	Neutral
948	Hibernate related maven conf.	Neutral
949	Suggestions that I found were.	Neutral
954	Regarding your 6 points.	Neutral
956	User hibernate validation 4 +.	Neutral
959	It is integrated in Hibernate 4.	Neutral
967	You do that explicitly, but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.	Neutral
968	No, that not required/related.	Neutral
973	How do you use all these dependencies?	Neutral
976	That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.	Neutral
980	If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.	Neutral
989	Any ideas?	Neutral
1002	Also, the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.	Neutral
1005	And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1018	You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
1020	It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.	Neutral
1024	So, to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1030	Any tip?	Neutral
1032	You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1042	thanks in advance.	Neutral
1051	Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.	Neutral
1061	Lastly, if you use tomcat, you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.	Neutral
1063	The source code is.	Neutral
1072	Has anyone ever tried to connect to a Yahoo Store using Yahoo API calls from Java?	Neutral
1075	I was able to figure this out.	Neutral
1085	Get the path of sd card.	Neutral
1091	If I have a array with 3 profiles.	Neutral
1094	Any ideas are appreciated.	Neutral
1107	No-one's picked this up, but why are you trying to mock private methods?	Neutral
1111	Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.	Neutral
1124	jMock, mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.	Neutral
1128	Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009, that is! )	Neutral
1133	Here is a code that I have written.	Neutral
1134	When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.	Neutral
1142	See the documentation of FileWriter.	Neutral
1149	You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1160	Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.	Neutral
1166	you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1168	for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.	Neutral
1175	Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page, which would sleep for 5 seconds, then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.	Neutral
1177	Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?	Neutral
1180	Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.	Neutral
1184	On the client side, you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.	Neutral
1191	You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME, something like this.	Neutral
1193	Hope that helps.	Neutral
1199	to get this index, use getElementIdx ( col, row ).	Neutral
1205	Here it is.	Neutral
1206	Declare below string FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1208	This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.	Neutral
1212	or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.	Neutral
1221	You can try and do nothing about it.	Neutral
1224	( Come on, put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here, as suggested by @BaileyS. )	Neutral
1231	Only unchecked exception, compiler can skip to check.	Neutral
1240	There are 3 things you can do.	Neutral
1275	The short instruction is.	Neutral
1277	Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.	Neutral
1281	Suppose to have an FILE_NAME, say CODE_FRAGMENT, and two non-abstract subclasses, say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1283	E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
1284	which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.	Neutral
1285	Finally, if I try to deserialize as follows.	Neutral
1294	I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.	Neutral
1297	API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.	Neutral
743	Problem solved.	Positive
808	I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT, but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.	Positive
823	It will do the correct, ``legal ''stuff.	Positive
910	There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Positive
1011	But in the main case it works good enough.	Positive
1017	Stable and production ready lib.	Positive
1036	Not an extremely expensive operation I think.	Positive
1100	because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.	Positive
1102	This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.	Positive
1103	Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
1167	This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.	Positive
1171	They both seem to print out the list fine.	Positive
1320	Well a solution that works for me.	Positive
1223	That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).	Negative
1230	AS I know, it's impossible in the case.	Negative
1244	It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.	Negative
1255	You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ), by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).	Negative
1261	Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7.	Negative
1336	Your API_NAME is messed up and doesn't list dependencies properly.	Negative
1388	Without that information you have to start the debugging process by guessing.	Negative
1424	so I'm not happy with it.	Negative
1455	Connections, on the other hand, are expensive and need to be managed carefully by the application.	Negative
1504	i try to return an output ( type date ) in a web service but i receive a weird result.	Negative
1566	My previous code example used CODE_FRAGMENT to fuse the filter and map operations, but this was cumbersome and provided no advantage.	Negative
1613	At the moment I am receiving a ClassNotFoundException to API_NAME.	Negative
1617	I added it into my ANT_HOME / lib directory, but it didn't have any effect.	Negative
1622	It didn't make any difference, I receive the same error.	Negative
1663	An SQL EXCEPTION is being caught saying API_NAME: [ Microsoft ] [ ODBC Driver Manager ] Data source name not found and no default driver specified ''.	Negative
1763	If you've created your File IO and pulled from it in a weird way, you can corrupt the encoding of the key material.	Negative

1339	Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1341	You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).	Neutral
1343	About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder, as you suggested, that's also possible.	Neutral
1344	Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral

1425	Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.	Neutral
1427	So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?	Neutral

1848	keyboard is what I named the Scanner.	Neutral
1849	This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.	Neutral
1850	If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement, right?	Neutral
1853	The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.	Neutral
1856	When the line is empty, it will return an empty string, CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
1861	you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.	Neutral
1865	Here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1866	And here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
1871	I've separated the loop body into two statements for clarity, but it's equivalent to.	Neutral

1890	I want it to use id instead.	Neutral
1892	I have the same problem, I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.	Neutral

2399	Not sure why but I am getting following error from my FILE_NAME.	Negative
1931	Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.	Neutral
1942	If you see the source code of this method you will see that.	Neutral
1948	This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.	Neutral
1950	The fact that the size constraint, and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason, not to add this behaviour to the method.	Neutral
1951	That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE_FRAGMENT implementation.	Neutral
1967	Here is what the content of FILE_NAME ended up looking like.	Neutral

1985	I am working on Spring MVC project in which I need to pass an object from my Controller to JSP and then I need to iterate that object and show them in a table FILE_NAME page.	Neutral
1986	Below is FILE_NAME which holds the data -.	Neutral
1992	Do I need to use JSTL for this?	Neutral
1993	Or there are any better approach for this?	Neutral
1994	We have a Java web application served from Apache Tomcat 6.	Neutral
1995	Our users are stored in a Windows 2008 R2 active directory.	Neutral
1996	The application connects to the AD using COM4J from the API_NAME library version NUMBER.	Neutral
2004	Finally, we found the problem.	Neutral
2005	It was caused by the scenario drawn at WEB_ADDRESS of Microsoft.	Neutral
2013	I am looking to plot cluster heat maps from gene expression data that I have.	Neutral
2018	I used Matthew Beckler's Java Heat Map a while ago.	Neutral

2072	You may try like this.	Neutral
2073	I try to split the String ``NUMBER ''to 2 new Strings.	Neutral
2074	but I get a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2076	You need to escape dot.	Neutral
2081	you have to use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2086	So, I thought I could create FILE_NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API_NAME code is in this answer.	Neutral
2088	So my Stream was finally.	Neutral
2094	The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter, map.	Neutral
2097	Short answer.	Neutral
2101	I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.	Neutral
2102	Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2105	Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT, such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.	Neutral
2107	This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.	Neutral
2111	We want parallel treatment of our items.	Neutral
2114	More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.	Neutral
2121	I finally found my error!	Neutral
2142	You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.	Neutral
2145	What can be the reason of this warnings?	Neutral
2149	Someone saying here that.	Neutral
2151	Yes, i am using maven.	Neutral
2152	Here is my API_NAME.	Neutral
2155	Add this dependency to your API_NAME.	Neutral
2159	Write to file.	Neutral
2161	My logcat.	Neutral
2164	Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2165	CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown, because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2168	If so, you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.	Neutral
2172	An CODE_FRAGMENT is.	Neutral
2174	I have a Unix command to send email.	Neutral
2178	Please guide me on this problem.	Neutral
2185	Well... no.	Neutral
2186	CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.	Neutral
2187	That is, it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.	Neutral
2190	It depends: which type of equality do you want?	Neutral
2194	Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2195	CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.	Neutral
2196	Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
2203	Where Object is FILE_NAME you want.	Neutral
2204	I found work around from this post WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2206	First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.	Neutral
2209	Then you can consume the service and get a strongly typed list via.	Neutral
2217	Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?	Neutral
2220	From the articles I read, I kind of get the following.	Neutral
2226	for which you can specify the target directory.	Neutral
2228	If we move forward with this, this is what I envision.	Neutral
2229	If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.	Neutral
2240	2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.	Neutral
2241	3 ) Edit API_NAME configuration file ( in the `bower_component's folder ) and specify path for each js library components.	Neutral
2254	I have a native library that I call using JNI.	Neutral
2260	A few notes.	Neutral
2265	See NativeSystem.	Neutral
2269	Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.	Neutral
2270	Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.	Neutral
2272	Quite contrary, on Windows.	Neutral
2284	Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here, or.	Neutral
2287	It will read a byte each time here.	Neutral
2290	Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.	Neutral
2292	After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
2293	and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.	Neutral
2295	On a sidenote.	Neutral
2312	CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.	Neutral
2315	This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).	Neutral
2322	Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding, use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.	Neutral
2323	Edit: - Missed to add one imp line, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2343	As to your point.	Neutral
2349	The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.	Neutral
2353	That shouldn't be an issue though.	Neutral
2363	It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range, too.	Neutral
2365	Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.	Neutral
2366	You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.	Neutral
2380	And then for FILE_NAME we have.	Neutral
2382	Examples of FILE_NAME names include.	Neutral
2386	Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form.	Neutral
2387	modified_package_name / name.	Neutral
2397	Hope this helps anyone out there!	Neutral
2403	WEB_ADDRESS #setString% API_NAME,% API_NAME% 29.	Neutral
2415	Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
2418	I have modified your code to add them.	Neutral
2421	Please refer to the code below.	Neutral
2423	I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.	Neutral
2425	And my Gradle File looks like this.	Neutral
2430	where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2432	If you include the appcompat lib as you do above, you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it, and the build system will do the right thing.	Neutral
2433	So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.	Neutral
2435	I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.	Neutral
2437	InsertandRetriveBlobData.	Neutral
2456	Starting with the socket IO, since Java 7 the NIO API has been available, which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.	Neutral
2461	You might also want to look at an API like Netty, which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.	Neutral
2463	Once you have a complete message, you need to process it.	Neutral
2470	Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage, current, temperature etc. ).	Neutral
2471	I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.	Neutral
2475	Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.	Neutral
2477	this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.	Neutral
1879	I suggest you to use.	Positive
1930	Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.	Positive
2137	This works for me.	Positive
2202	For me this worked.	Positive
2225	Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.	Positive
2231	It does its job, but was built for our use case.	Positive
2271	That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.	Positive
2364	I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.	Positive
2367	I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.	Positive
2396	So this works.	Positive
2545	In lieu of that, however, in my experience, ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity, flexibility, and ease-of-use.	Positive
2649	As others have already said, JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.	Positive
2669	There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.	Positive
2468	The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.	Negative
2479	since a day I have a very annoying problem - I can't run any Spring MVC application: / Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation.	Negative
2533	Any idea what i might be doing wrong.	Negative
2575	I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.	Negative
2578	Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.	Negative
2584	i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.	Negative
2606	I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism, as it would produce a lot of overhead.	Negative
2656	I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query, it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.	Negative
2705	Less margin for error.	Negative
2745	Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.	Negative
2796	I was unable to get a perfect match.	Negative
2824	I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally.	Negative
2841	You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!	Negative
2862	There is, of course, an API for the DRL compiler's parser, but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax, which is considerable.	Negative
2872	I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.	Negative
2899	But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.	Negative
2928	This is an absurd, unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.	Negative
2938	First of all I do not think you need all these.	Negative
2480	So i created this from scratch.	Neutral
2482	and of course API_NAME.	Neutral
2490	it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.	Neutral
2493	What am I missing???	Neutral
2495	However, you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.	Neutral
2497	It's documentation can be found here.	Neutral
2506	a way to get FILE_NAME type, thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.	Neutral
2519	In a word: No.	Neutral
2522	What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?	Neutral
2523	Which one should be reported?	Neutral
2526	You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them.	Neutral
2531	Using this, i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.	Neutral
2536	Some other pointer.	Neutral
2538	I am using API_NAME for encoding.	Neutral
2540	Working Python Code.	Neutral
2541	I'm looking for a well-maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API.	Neutral
2556	Take a look at this article.	Neutral
2579	Maybe you could do the same that he did, i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?	Neutral
2580	( see: this answer ).	Neutral
2583	how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?	Neutral
2602	There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.	Neutral
2604	I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.	Neutral
2605	How is blocking performed?	Neutral
2608	No, they don't use busy-waiting.	Neutral
2609	It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ), but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API, so the efficiency will depend on the OS.	Neutral
2611	the exception is on line 72 and 114.	Neutral
2613	Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).	Neutral
2628	This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x, hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.	Neutral
2635	One which is the Pro full API.	Neutral
2637	I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.	Neutral
2641	When you build, you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus, artifactory, etc ), and then you would have 2 separate jars.	Neutral
2643	A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.	Neutral
2644	You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.	Neutral
2645	Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.	Neutral

2741	In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).	Neutral
2744	Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2759	You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter/setter, so instead of.	Neutral
2762	Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2763	Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2765	Also to note, when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF/server/J2EE you are using ( without such information, we can not tell you which annotations you should use ).	Neutral
2770	Do i need to use event mechanism?	Neutral

2896	Adding API_NAME ( ) after awaitTermination ( ) method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for.	Neutral
2897	I took help from this Question.	Neutral
2901	System prints data like this.	Neutral
2910	If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.	Neutral
2914	So, basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.	Neutral
2918	You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.	Neutral
2920	Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2921	It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.	Neutral
2922	UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII, two bytes for many europe languages.	Neutral
2923	Also each String object contains reference to char array.	Neutral
2926	So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ), and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.	Neutral
2941	And then in your other file.	Neutral
2948	Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library, see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
2951	But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the API_NAME.	Neutral
2959	In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.	Neutral
2963	I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.	Neutral
2983	Please see attached cause exception.	Neutral
2988	You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client, you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.	Neutral
2994	You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started.	Neutral
2995	Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here.	Neutral
2997	I am using Android Studio.	Neutral
3002	The logcat is as below.	Neutral
3003	Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?	Neutral
3007	FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.	Neutral
3015	My API_NAME seems to include the reference.	Neutral
3020	Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3029	As well, I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop,.	Neutral
3031	I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.	Neutral
3032	I have also tried to use.	Neutral
3037	( In this case I would have used.	Neutral
3050	Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.	Neutral
3055	so, how we can parse above like example expression easier, or FILE_NAME api for string parser.	Neutral
3076	This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
3080	Now I want this, when the user check a shipper by EditTextView, I have from database an Object.	Neutral
3081	I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.	Neutral
3082	Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.	Neutral
3084	So instead of setting Bundle to null, you can do something like this.	Neutral
3085	Check out this link for more info.	Neutral
3099	I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call,.	Neutral
3106	This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added, in the providers list.	Neutral
2761	Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.	Positive
2805	Solved, in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.	Positive
2904	Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.	Positive
2907	This solution is more flexible.	Positive
2940	but if you want you can do this.	Positive
2942	I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.	Positive
2953	With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.	Positive
3173	There are many ways to solve it, the simplest is call.	Positive
3185	The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.	Positive
3226	You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.	Positive
3337	Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT, useful for quantifier syntax.	Positive
3404	The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3427	In any case, manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.	Positive
2958	This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.	Negative
2965	But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.	Negative
2971	then I gets the module error again from JNA.	Negative
2999	This line gives the error.	Negative
3024	I am using standout library, I added a videoView in it, Everything is running correctly, Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.	Negative
3132	And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
3134	But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.	Negative
3172	You have problem with classpath.	Negative
3186	Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.	Negative
3214	I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.	Negative
3244	If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.	Negative
3287	does not work without previously setting the FILE_NAME.	Negative
3366	They all fail with the following error.	Negative
3382	The following is the error I keep getting.	Negative
3396	But it isn't working like I expected.	Negative
3398	But unexpectedly, I am getting 66.	Negative
3430	As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.	Negative
3569	Why is it reading it wrongly?	Negative
3107	I'm new to FILE_NAME language.	Neutral
3126	In Java, you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.	Neutral
3135	Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. )	Neutral
3145	If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java, use a FILE_NAME.	Neutral
3163	So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3193	When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.	Neutral
3212	I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.	Neutral
3224	Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it, loop through it, create a Comparator etc..	Neutral
3232	I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.	Neutral
3238	You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.	Neutral
3250	I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.	Neutral
3256	The program is just a hello world Program.	Neutral
3267	You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.	Neutral
3269	CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.	Neutral
3282	( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes, though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. )	Neutral
3288	Finally, ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.	Neutral
3290	So you can do.	Neutral
3294	One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.	Neutral
3300	The code in Java is.	Neutral
3302	What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.	Neutral
3321	This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.	Neutral
3322	Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3323	Are they equivalent?	Neutral
3340	I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy, hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example, instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.	Neutral
3341	They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3346	I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.	Neutral
3352	So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.	Neutral
3359	Try to download *.	Neutral
3361	May be some resources will need to be copied from archives, too.	Neutral
3368	Let me know if there are any other details that might help!	Neutral
3370	Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3372	Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.	Neutral
3389	Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).	Neutral
3393	For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3395	I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.	Neutral
3407	If you want to print a int as binary, use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.	Neutral
3409	Version of Spring is NUMBER.	Neutral
3410	I have a session bean, declared as.	Neutral
3413	After debugging, i found out, that when test spring context is started, in the.	Neutral
3422	You can add a util method to your test, something like.	Neutral
3426	In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3429	See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.	Neutral
3432	However, having said that, if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT, you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.	Neutral
3435	Obviously, the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT, but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT, etc..	Neutral
3438	Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ).	Neutral
3445	And DispatherConfig is this.	Neutral
3446	Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.	Neutral
3448	hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.	Neutral
3453	Let's put your code inside a method.	Neutral
3454	If you use CODE_FRAGMENT, the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.	Neutral
3457	If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.	Neutral
3462	The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp, which access the Oracle database.	Neutral
3463	This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.	Neutral
3464	Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?	Neutral
3468	Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java, see if this works for you.	Neutral
3469	Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.	Neutral
3472	When I run this on Windows, the console tells me.	Neutral
3484	Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?	Neutral
3487	Note, however, it's called CODE_FRAGMENT, with a capital D.	Neutral
3492	Question 2: From the javadoc.	Neutral
3493	So yes, you need to keep track of the position yourself.	Neutral
3502	But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
3510	What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.	Neutral
3514	Something like below,.	Neutral
3524	Hope it clarifies.	Neutral
3539	I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.	Neutral
3548	Which outputs.	Neutral
3553	I have a string like this.	Neutral
3554	Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.	Neutral
3556	url WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
3557	is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?	Neutral
3564	I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.	Neutral
3568	And I got the output like this.	Neutral
3577	mm stands for minutes.	Neutral
3584	So, using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.	Neutral
3589	Accourding to this answer.	Neutral
3592	IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.	Neutral
3596	and call the client as follows.	Neutral
3598	The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.	Neutral
3599	API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.	Neutral
3600	Please see the following sample code.	Neutral
3605	en-dash & em-dash word count differs from MS-Office.	Neutral
3616	Hi I have a sample log file here.	Neutral
3630	The API_NAME ( String regex,.	Neutral
3632	You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.	Neutral
3634	The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.	Neutral
3656	To stop this runnable, you have to call this when needed.	Neutral
3661	And a string contains the name of the enum.	Neutral
3665	You have to do it like this.	Neutral
3666	Here's an alternative way.	Neutral
3669	Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.	Neutral
3683	Here is the actual data sent.	Neutral
3703	I think you also have to look at the database configuration.	Neutral
3709	The package gets deleted in the registry.	Neutral
3719	install4j transforms entered package names to path names, so ''.''	Neutral
3730	Using FILE_NAME I can do something like this.	Neutral
3737	Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated.	Neutral
3739	If call is successful, the onResponse ( ) method is called.	Neutral
3740	If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.	Neutral
3743	I'm trying to inject a DAO using @Autowire.	Neutral
3750	Any advice is welcome.	Neutral
3752	FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).	Neutral
3753	Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.	Neutral
3755	You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.	Neutral
3758	In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?	Neutral
3759	I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work, scope wise.	Neutral
3761	I am curious about the problem I have proposed.	Neutral
3768	Thank you in advance!	Neutral
3772	That being said, the JARs you see there only support JPA, not core Hibernate.	Neutral
3780	But, i didn't give me the thing i need!	Neutral
3781	How can i do that?	Neutral
3785	Since CODE_FRAGMENT is a meta character, and it's have a special meaning in regex.	Neutral
3788	What method should I use to update existing ldap objects?	Neutral
3790	Person repo interface.	Neutral
3797	I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.	Neutral
3811	What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?	Neutral
3824	You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.	Neutral
3844	If so, then how far does this go; for example, could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?	Neutral
3847	I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.	Neutral
3480	The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.	Positive
3547	The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.	Positive
3560	It seems, after a quick google search, that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
3562	This might prove to be useful unbescape.	Positive
3635	Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length, the simplest solution is.	Positive
3922	There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.	Positive
3941	Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.	Positive
4055	That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.	Positive
4126	And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.	Positive
4261	Ok, I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).	Positive
4423	Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.	Positive
4570	That's correct behavior.	Positive
4651	I finally managed to get it to work.	Positive
3622	The error is as shown below.	Negative
3623	Exception in thread ``main`` API_NAME: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type.	Negative
3639	I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.	Negative
3679	The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.	Negative
3681	I tried the following and it returns nothing.	Negative
3798	I searched a lot but i not found any solution.	Negative
3842	What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck, deadlocked, inside CODE_FRAGMENT, then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?	Negative
3848	When I tried to compile the tool, I get n error.	Negative
3853	I don't know what else to do to make things to work.	Negative
3897	I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.	Negative
3927	I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ), but it is not displaying.	Negative
3935	I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT, but there is none.	Negative
3965	but still nothing.	Negative
4040	But it's not necessary for our case.	Negative
4079	Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.	Negative
4109	I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.	Negative
4141	I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.	Negative
4149	I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.	Negative
3851	I also have set JAVA_HOME.	Neutral
3855	Use full path in ANT_HOME, eg.	Neutral
3856	It dependes where it is exactly located.	Neutral
3865	Thanks and Greeting!	Neutral
3872	So the question is.	Neutral
3887	If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ), they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.	Neutral
3888	This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.	Neutral
3894	try this type code.	Neutral
3899	In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.	Neutral
3901	and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).	Neutral
3905	If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT, you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.	Neutral
3907	If you need to shorten the button code, Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.	Neutral
3909	Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.	Neutral
3915	You can use syntax like.	Neutral
3916	I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.	Neutral
3919	In your code, you need to replace.	Neutral
3920	Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.	Neutral
3921	Which creates the file writer in append mode, see the docs here.	Neutral
3928	Here is a MacOSX MenuBar.	Neutral
3929	Below is my code.	Neutral
3931	I am running the program as a Java Application.	Neutral
3937	Some technical details.	Neutral
3938	I am using Java SE version NUMBER.	Neutral
3939	My computer's OS is Mac OS X NUMBER.	Neutral
3948	You can see in the code above I use this to call my bean in the other proyect.	Neutral
3950	I also tried using this.	Neutral
3959	Wildfly Developer Guide.	Neutral
3963	The code i am using is.	Neutral
3966	Assume you have this directory layout.	Neutral
3983	What's happening?	Neutral
3992	I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.	Neutral
3993	It started about a month ago, after a deployment.	Neutral
4001	CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.	Neutral
4004	As part of GC, first minor GC is triggered.	Neutral
4007	I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?	Neutral
4013	So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first, and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.	Neutral
4018	You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4020	Also, based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject, the unit is milliseconds, not seconds.	Neutral
4021	Try these longer term things in the long term.	Neutral
4022	If you can, try the G1GC collector.	Neutral
4023	You are using Java 7, so if you can in your current environment, give it a try.	Neutral
4024	It's meant for performance with big heaps.	Neutral
4030	Remember, the bigger the heap, the longer the garbage collector takes, irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.	Neutral
4031	You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.	Neutral
4038	Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.	Neutral
4043	At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4046	You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints, and still receive compile-time verification.	Neutral
4047	One way would be.	Neutral
4050	FILE_NAME does one thing, and does it well.	Neutral
4052	( If you're not using Java 8, it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one, and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )	Neutral
4054	You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4060	Thanks alot!	Neutral
4062	So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name, not price, the 2nd will changed as well, but not the opposite!	Neutral

4108	I develop Cursive.	Neutral
4130	NUMBER mapping-file, FILE_NAME-file, FILE_NAME, exclude-unlisted-classes.	Neutral
4132	So I obtained the following project structure.	Neutral
4133	I modified the ``API_NAME ''file.	Neutral
4168	safety and scope beans to current thread.	Neutral
4172	As you can see some of the code is generated at runtime in methods by CGLib enhancer.	Neutral
4175	Any suggestions or interesting links appreciated!	Neutral
4178	And all injections occurs just once - on application starting.	Neutral
4182	Let's find out, how scoped beans do work.	Neutral
4189	Now, about scoped proxies.	Neutral
4191	This means, that every time you will operate on the exact same object, that was originally injected on start.	Neutral
4194	To do it, as said in documentation, declare you bean as proxified.	Neutral
4197	CODE_FRAGMENT working almost same way.	Neutral
4204	The text file has 10 lines of data and each line contains a piece of data in the format of: ``Integer1-String1: String2 ''example:`` 123-ABC: DEFG''.	Neutral
4212	You might want to create a FILE_NAME for your data.	Neutral
4224	Obtain the raw lines and keep them in a ( Clojure ) lazy sequence.	Neutral
4247	On the right side of notification android is showing time.	Neutral
4252	Refer more than here: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
4257	Currently, I create the index like so.	Neutral
4260	Any help will be greatly appreciated.	Neutral
4263	Create your index like so.	Neutral
4264	And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.	Neutral
4266	To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.	Neutral
4274	Why not?	Neutral
4277	What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT, which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.	Neutral
4278	It isn't, not at least at JPA level.	Neutral
4283	This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.	Neutral
4284	( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).	Neutral
4292	Currently, I have a method.	Neutral
4293	The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that, I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.	Neutral
4307	CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT, in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).	Neutral
4310	There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory, so you're done.	Neutral
4313	All of that can just go.	Neutral
4327	I have set up the Interface as follows.	Neutral
4330	where mOut is an ActivityInterface.	Neutral
4332	If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4341	Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.	Neutral
4353	That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int, int ) can not be referenced from a static context '', because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.	Neutral
4358	Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.	Neutral
4362	I inject the beans with AutowireHelper.	Neutral
4378	Recently, I tried to implement the AppBarLayout with tabs.	Neutral
4380	I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4382	And here is the result in an emulator.	Neutral
4385	Here is the XML layout.	Neutral
4386	There's some configuration settings that look like they can be defined for the ObjectMapper that controls the behaviour of the root element.	Neutral
4387	WEB_ADDRESS #UNWRAP_ROOT_VALUE - see FILE_NAME #WRAP_ROOT_VALUE as well.	Neutral
4389	Config example for spring is available at.	Neutral
4391	I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.	Neutral
4395	How do I achieve this?	Neutral
4398	Is there a configuration for Jackson/Spring that I am missing?	Neutral
4400	The complete error message is.	Neutral
4401	Just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4403	I tried below code and I got this output.	Neutral
4409	HashSet ( Java Platform SE 8 ) says.	Neutral
4413	We have a requirement to show only -LCB- RED, BLUE -RCB- in a certain user interface?	Neutral
4415	see CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4652	Thank you dunni for your help, you've put me on the right path.	Positive
4654	And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.	Positive
4710	but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.	Positive
4711	Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.	Positive
4737	FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.	Positive
4847	This answer describes what is happening more clearly.	Positive
4853	For example, the following works great.	Positive
4897	It is able to handle all polygon cases, including the self-intersecting ones.	Positive
4982	Comparison time should be fast, so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.	Positive
5005	Congratulations.	Positive
5007	Databases are much better at handling data than Java.	Positive
5008	Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster, with less CPU, less memory and less network traffic.	Positive
5015	Embrace the Joy of Sets!	Positive
4167	I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib, but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.	Negative
4275	This is your problem.	Negative
4295	This is not my intention.	Negative
4333	I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.	Negative
4551	This isn't valid Java.	Negative
4578	Well, the funny part is, we do not know.	Negative
4596	The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.	Negative
4636	This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.	Negative
4637	The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4645	I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.	Negative
4698	The problem is that you wrote.	Negative
4775	I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4812	I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT, but with the fix above we no longer need that, we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
4813	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.	Negative
4841	CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.	Negative
4861	Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.	Negative
4869	I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.	Negative
4940	Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.	Negative
4420	See from Javadocs of String #compareTo.	Neutral
4422	I have a service which writes input stream to a file.	Neutral
4426	FILE_NAME: 30 line is basically CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4429	As I read more into the article, I see that there is an API that looks like this.	Neutral
4430	If I invoke this API using something like CODE_FRAGMENT and build my request like so, ( provided that I have authentication headers and a POST body included ).	Neutral
4431	Would I in theory, be able to send a notification with whatever information I want to that device?	Neutral
4442	If you use the XMPP protocol.	Neutral
4443	You should implement a connection server that manages the connection to FCM to handle upstream and downstream messages.	Neutral
4453	Applet and JSP Communication.	Neutral
4454	I have tomcat hosting my website FILE_NAME api for database management.	Neutral
4458	Anyone have any idea on the problem?	Neutral
4462	I know the question is very broad but please help me thanks.	Neutral
4469	You can read more about it here.	Neutral
4470	i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.	Neutral
4477	Either pass 4 digit year or fix your pattern.	Neutral
4478	Maybe i found a solution to your problem.	Neutral
4485	Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core, tomcat-embed-websocket, tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )	Neutral
4489	Thanks in advance!	Neutral
4490	I am writing a cloud-sync application in Java with.	Neutral
4496	P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.	Neutral
4498	Thank you for any hint.	Neutral
4499	I just found a solution for Java NUMBER + in combination with native and jni dlls.	Neutral
4507	In my CODE_FRAGMENT script I have.	Neutral
4508	The repository description on MVNrepository lists several compile dependencies, including Selenium-Chrome-Driver, Selenium-FirefoSMILE_FACEriver, etc..	Neutral
4513	The image below shows that it's being compiled from the Maven script.	Neutral
4516	So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver, you need to.	Neutral
4522	How to do that is explained here.	Neutral
4527	You don't have to base64-encode the access token before use.	Neutral
4532	Later I came to know that wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Character, etc are immutable by nature, so why do we need Atomic * classes like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong.	Neutral
4544	Concept of atomicity comes when something is mutable.	Neutral
4556	The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.	Neutral
4568	When you add 3 hours, you will get March 30, 2010 02:00 UTC.	Neutral
4572	Precisely at March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC, so March 30, 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30, 2010: 01:59 CEST, but March 30, 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30, 2010 03:00 CEST.	Neutral
4575	In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.	Neutral
4580	That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying, otherwise you risk an ambiguity.	Neutral
4583	Here is an example ( please, note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).	Neutral
4588	When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!	Neutral
4590	Where is my mistake?	Neutral
4600	I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.	Neutral
4602	You might do something like this.	Neutral
4613	Omitted time zone.	Neutral
4615	Should have been translated to UTC time.	Neutral
4619	Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4620	No Midnight.	Neutral
4624	Some comments about this source code.	Neutral
4626	Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.	Neutral
4647	EAR dependencies.	Neutral
4648	The datasource should load from jndi, this is my API_NAME.	Neutral
4653	And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4659	i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.	Neutral
4666	You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.	Neutral
4671	I want to ask some questions.	Neutral
4677	( My question is here, how to list the music on JScrollPane?? )	Neutral
4679	If i double click each music ( sample1, sample2 ), the music that I choose is playing.	Neutral
4682	I want the music's name that I choose.	Neutral
4684	like sample1, sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? )	Neutral
4689	I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.	Neutral
4699	But you should have written.	Neutral
4700	I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7,.	Neutral
4701	I can send POST request with this code.	Neutral
4713	Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.	Neutral
4714	startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusive.	Neutral
4717	To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.	Neutral
4726	Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.	Neutral
4727	This is a list in python.	Neutral
4728	This is how the slice operator would work.	Neutral
4746	OutputRaw solve me issue.	Neutral
4747	I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).	Neutral
4749	Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..	Neutral
4752	So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT, CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4761	The output that I get is -.	Neutral
4770	The statement should have been.	Neutral
4779	Here is what I have now.	Neutral
4780	Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!	Neutral
4783	ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).	Neutral
4788	That said, you have a couple options.	Neutral
4789	You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.	Neutral
4793	This would look like.	Neutral
4795	I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.	Neutral
4796	Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.	Neutral
4814	Just delete the method.	Neutral
4815	CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.	Neutral
4817	Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4823	Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).	Neutral
4826	I cant use Date format,, only string.	Neutral
4835	Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).	Neutral
4842	But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.	Neutral
4843	More details in thread.	Neutral
4848	In my case, I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.	Neutral
4859	The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.	Neutral
4863	Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.	Neutral
4865	can not be cast to API_NAME.	Neutral
4873	The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.	Neutral
4874	---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.	Neutral
4875	I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here, such as Velocity and FreeMarker.	Neutral
4883	The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).	Neutral
4885	I have 2D closed vector paths, specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.	Neutral
4905	I expect to do a system when you can do a survey, and then, press a button, open a new activity and see survey answers.	Neutral
4908	Here is my code of the survey, XML and JAVA.	Neutral
4913	like this just capture all user input data, No need for the database in this.	Neutral
4914	Here list is the list of all question you are having....	Neutral
4916	getQuestion and similarly with answer.	Neutral
4918	I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.	Neutral
4924	In this situation, when I click on the greyed out widget, I need to start the app.	Neutral
4926	how I could achieve this.	Neutral
4930	You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4948	Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy, something like this.	Neutral
4949	Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT, not CODE_FRAGMENT, because the latter only processes public fields.	Neutral
4953	Let's assume my model looks like this.	Neutral
4957	I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids, calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.	Neutral
4961	Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.	Neutral
4966	Plese guide.	Neutral
4967	Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required, NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).	Neutral
4968	Targetting to achieve.	Neutral
4969	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string, e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4970	If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT, you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.	Neutral
4984	New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.	Neutral
4990	Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
4996	Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.	Neutral
5026	I understand the boolean expression here.	Positive
5052	If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way, try CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5073	This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.	Positive
5244	Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.	Positive
5262	it's worth a shot.	Positive
5324	I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.	Positive
5381	It's really good.	Positive
5382	It's an excellent, fast library.	Positive
5408	At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.	Positive
5497	check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.	Positive
5518	This works fine.	Positive
5600	It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
5626	The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.	Positive
4942	Because it's not initialized yet.	Negative
4945	( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
4947	I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT, but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.	Negative
5101	Since this is correct, why byte code noting down the return type of the called method, and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.	Negative
5128	Data loss.	Negative
5219	When I run the project, I get the following error,.	Negative
5256	As you can see, the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering, it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.	Negative
5307	As others have stated, this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.	Negative
5310	We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.	Negative
5364	All seems OK, but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).	Negative
5385	... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.	Negative
5409	I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).	Negative
5478	( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles, it's the same issue. )	Negative
5542	It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.	Negative
5567	I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5607	Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work, unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.	Negative
5623	There is a caveat with the above approach.	Negative
5636	It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build, and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib, there might occur CNF-Exceptions.	Negative
5003	Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT, iterating the submap, giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.	Neutral
5016	Hmmm.	Neutral
5027	But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?	Neutral
5030	So you can see, since CODE_FRAGMENT, exception is not thrown.	Neutral
5034	Can you help in understanding this code.	Neutral
5035	Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.	Neutral
5056	In the code you referenced, readLine is called on a BufferedReader.	Neutral
5061	An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.	Neutral
5063	The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.	Neutral
5071	In your particular example, the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.	Neutral
5078	Here's an example of a JSON structure.	Neutral
5079	Here it's the function that parses the json.	Neutral
5082	I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic, I don't always know what structure will come from it.	Neutral
5087	Can I use a recursive function?	Neutral
5093	Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.	Neutral
5113	Consider the following interface.	Neutral
5114	Due to type erasure, it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.	Neutral
5115	Now consider the following FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5122	Avoid legacy date-time classes.	Neutral
5129	The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.	Neutral
5133	Instead, use API_NAME classes.	Neutral
5135	When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT, immediately convert to API_NAME types.	Neutral
5137	In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7, use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5138	An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
5141	API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.	Neutral
5144	To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial.	Neutral
5146	Specification is JSR 310.	Neutral
5161	Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?	Neutral
5165	Use it.	Neutral
5168	You probably mean.	Neutral
5172	e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5173	I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.	Neutral
5174	The regex is.	Neutral
5176	I am using this.	Neutral
5184	You can use this regex.	Neutral
5185	You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.	Neutral
5196	If so, please show an example.	Neutral
5203	What is best practice while testing Android Services?	Neutral
5208	After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process, following the instructions from here, I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.	Neutral
5218	I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below,.	Neutral
5220	I took several measures,.	Neutral
5223	What should I do to solve the issue?	Neutral
5225	I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.	Neutral
5233	How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?	Neutral
5257	Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general, or a bug in Java, or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text, or have I missed something?	Neutral
5258	Graphics Initialization.	Neutral
5260	I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.	Neutral
5267	See here.	Neutral
5275	url: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
5284	I've given an example below.	Neutral
5293	There are several options.	Neutral
5295	Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.	Neutral
5317	Since that time we've tended more toward option two.	Neutral
5322	I will post it here if I find anything new.	Neutral
5325	But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.	Neutral
5333	you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.	Neutral
5339	and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.	Neutral
5342	There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.	Neutral
5344	This is especially true for long lived callbacks.	Neutral
5347	Otherwise, it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.	Neutral
5359	Here is the code that does the push.	Neutral
5365	Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).	Neutral
5370	For the records, I found it ;o).	Neutral
5372	For deails see Adobe forums thread.	Neutral
5374	Enjoy and thank you for your time!	Neutral
5378	FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.	Neutral
5392	Or simply use Maven repository.	Neutral
5394	Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.	Neutral
5395	Add other jars from your JDK.	Neutral
5397	All projects will see the changed JRE definition.	Neutral
5437	See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.	Neutral
5438	( And please reformat your code ).	Neutral
5446	The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.	Neutral
5448	The customer leaves the salon.	Neutral
5450	If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.	Neutral
5454	I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.	Neutral
5463	You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.	Neutral
5464	As long as the customer does not enter the saloon, it holds NotSleeping.	Neutral
5480	Here's an example.	Neutral
5484	In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.	Neutral
5489	Use FILE_NAME instead of float.	Neutral
5490	And use Java code like this.	Neutral
5491	I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5498	If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.	Neutral
5500	For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.	Neutral
5505	How can i solve it.	Neutral
5509	Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it, the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5512	Well, you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5517	You have to new it up.	Neutral
5519	Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT, this will help.	Neutral
5523	I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.	Neutral
5525	The FILE_NAME looks like this.	Neutral
5537	Check if your Table has that style bit.	Neutral
5539	I added.	Neutral
5548	Here is an example in Java.	Neutral
5551	To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.	Neutral
5552	Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.	Neutral
5559	After the request is done, all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.	Neutral
5561	The output looks like this.	Neutral
5563	When that is ready I shall post the code.	Neutral
5565	An usage example.	Neutral
5582	While I would expect.	Neutral
5593	To register the bean, try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.	Neutral
5613	Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.	Neutral
5615	In a similar manner, you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.	Neutral
5635	my beans are destroyed, How on startup I can get the same bean registered.	Neutral
5637	As of JUnit there shouldnt be a dependency for your build, right?	Neutral
5640	I Add Junit >> > right click on project - > properties - > Java Build Path - > libraries - > add library.	Neutral
5643	Warning is -.	Neutral
5653	My code follows.	Neutral
5657	Use the SVN Kit library instead.	Neutral
5683	So in other words, it would be a bug to recieve a non workday in this example.	Neutral
5684	Store the valid strings in a CODE_FRAGMENT, and decide whether a string is a valid day or not based on CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5692	Let me know if you need more details.	Neutral
5700	I know its an old post, but I believe following result will be still interesting.	Neutral
5702	The table below shows time required by simple loop and CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5708	I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.	Neutral
5720	May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?	Neutral
5724	I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.	Neutral
5658	Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several, I am not sure which one is better ), it's more straightforward solution.	Positive
5668	But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.	Positive
5671	I still think it's not the best design, but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.	Positive
5680	Or since in NUMBER% of cases, day will be correct.	Positive
5685	The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT, and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.	Positive
5694	Even in your own parsing approach, you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.	Positive
5707	This should almost be obvious.	Positive
5731	The application is complete and working fine.	Positive
5792	And this code worked.	Positive
5867	Working Configuration.	Positive
5903	There is a solution to your problem.	Positive
5916	This configuration works very well.	Positive
5924	( Hopefully with a good example. )	Positive
5649	If I run the code in the GUI, it just hangs.	Negative
5655	I have looked and found that there are some packages that would automatically enter my keyring on login but that isn't really an option.	Negative
5670	When I first saw it, I was horrified.	Negative
5718	Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve, though.	Negative
5791	This code failed.	Negative
5803	You can not supply system properties to the API_NAME tool, unfortunately.	Negative
5812	I have found out that certain misconfigured servers send an ``Unrecognized Name ''warning in the SSL handshake which is ignored by most clients... except for Java.	Negative
5878	You can't open CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.	Negative
5887	This is an issue with how volley handles HTTPUrlConnection and retry policy.	Negative
5964	So it's basically in the wrong form.	Negative
5996	Avoid them.	Negative
6114	This may or may not work.	Negative
6309	On Facebook i ran in to a problem.	Negative
6316	The result was the same that i don't have the correct permissions.	Negative
6326	I am new to this so maybe i'm doing somthing wrong.	Negative
6329	And now my app is getting it's app Token and i can use it to publish messages but the problem is those messages can not be viewed on the app page it self.	Negative
6378	There's no way to do that, AFAIK.	Negative
6385	You can't suspend a thread like that.	Negative
5726	There is a dynamic templating component that is moving from the tapx component library to core Tapestry in NUMBER.	Neutral
5728	Here is a brief description of it.	Neutral
5732	A small description of application is as follow.	Neutral
5733	The application is basically an object manager, where user add new object, remove old objects and connect object with each other.	Neutral
5738	What Left.	Neutral
5744	cricle and fill that with red.	Neutral
5752	However, I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..	Neutral
5753	Using this you'd basically only have to define your object graph.	Neutral
5761	can someone help me how to do this with a piece of code.	Neutral
5777	Thanks in advance to everyone.	Neutral
5779	You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.	Neutral
5780	This website shows how.	Neutral
5789	I had what I believe the same issue is.	Neutral
5790	I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.	Neutral
5795	Was being sent from the server to the client.	Neutral
5801	If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).	Neutral
5806	UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.	Neutral
5815	To allow your programs to work without re-compiling, run your app as.	Neutral
5827	When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ), retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT, but this time without a host name.	Neutral
5842	Alarmingly, my customer has discovered a setting in the Java control panel which resolves this.	Neutral
5849	Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.	Neutral
5862	Restart your Tomcat ( important ).	Neutral
5863	Just to add a solution here.	Neutral
5868	My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.	Neutral
5877	The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.	Neutral
5880	Btw, you can also try apache http components.	Neutral
5900	You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.	Neutral
5905	here is an example hot to use countdownlatch.	Neutral
5908	If you have access to the configuration of your EJB container and you can set the executor, then you could Guava's addCallback method.	Neutral
5911	Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService, so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.	Neutral
5915	I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.	Neutral
5933	Basically, the component type is mandatory for JSF in order to create the component by CODE_FRAGMENT method.	Neutral
5936	The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5944	tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.	Neutral
5951	I have just a quick question: Are files created before they are finished, or are they finished and then created?	Neutral
5966	How do I get this string into the form of a JSONArray so that I can access it's elements.	Neutral
5971	I'm printing a String.	Neutral
5977	In the below code, a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.	Neutral
5978	So, the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.	Neutral
5983	The book time should be from 20:00 -6:00.	Neutral
5984	whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.	Neutral
6001	The length of the appointments, the span of time not yet attached to the timeline, should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6004	Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT, FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.	Neutral
6007	For example, 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN, and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.	Neutral
6008	You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.	Neutral
6018	CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.	Neutral
6024	When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time, combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.	Neutral
6030	Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.	Neutral
6031	Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.	Neutral
6032	We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.	Neutral
6036	The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.	Neutral
6038	Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.	Neutral
6040	We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.	Neutral
6048	The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration API_NAME.	Neutral
6057	Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?	Neutral
6059	With CODE_FRAGMENT, this example took NUMBER seconds with the option on and NUMBER second with it off in Java 6 update 29.	Neutral
6064	( Should be visible in a couple of days ).	Neutral
6067	It seems Oracle really removed the option.	Neutral
6070	Loading and storing bytes in the byte [ ] consumes 1/2 the bandwidth versus chars in the char [ ].	Neutral

6133	If so we count the number of substrings.	Neutral
6137	API_NAME: String index out of range: 3.	Neutral
6140	On each iteration through the loop, you're incrementing CODE_FRAGMENT as well as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral

6183	read here.	Neutral
6186	In the following 2 lines of code.	Neutral
6188	What is context and what is CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6190	Then what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6191	While working with netbeans I have to make a new file of category CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6192	What is a CODE_FRAGMENT and what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?	Neutral
6203	Jar file check following link.	Neutral
6205	Hope it will help you.	Neutral
6218	So what do you think?	Neutral
6221	Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.	Neutral
6222	Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
6224	Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.	Neutral
6225	It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.	Neutral
6229	Since this is homework, here's some hints.	Neutral
6236	To clarify, a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.	Neutral
6240	Let's look at a sample call.	Neutral
6248	You can still compare numerically, which was the goal all along!	Neutral
6254	and finally here is the FILE_NAME.	Neutral
6273	Assuming instance variables, frst way, EC, CC, PT are ZERO.	Neutral
6280	CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.	Neutral
6289	No, it's not the same.	Neutral
6294	only HC will be initialized.	Neutral
6295	all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).	Neutral
6298	You can also do it as follows.	Neutral
6299	First declare all variables.	Neutral
6300	Then assign value.	Neutral
6302	If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC, CC, PT and HC values are one.	Neutral
6304	Documentation: WEB_ADDRESS.	Neutral
6305	I'm trying to post comments on an app page in Facebook.	Neutral
6310	From what i have found the only API that is almost up to date is RestFB.	Neutral
6319	Is this api up to date?	Neutral
6321	Furthermore is there any other better api?	Neutral
6325	Here is the code that i am using to post a comment.	Neutral
6330	I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.	Neutral
6331	Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?	Neutral
6340	#NAME?	Neutral
6347	I tried something like this.	Neutral
6348	The result was byte [ ].	Neutral
6356	You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.	Neutral
6358	As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself, consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.	Neutral
6361	Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components, and the progress bar can be customized.	Neutral
6363	Say, after several text appended to a text area, I want this to be appended.	Neutral
6364	``Please wait, a download is in progress ''.	Neutral
6365	After that a download progress status with progress meter character '#' gets appended.	Neutral
5927	The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.	Positive
5990	Also, JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler.	Positive
6077	The option reduces heap usage.	Positive
6080	For workloads that are memory capacity constrained ( i.e. have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time ), this option can prove useful.	Positive
6089	CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example, instead of copying.	Positive
6094	With the new design, they could also support other encodings in future.	Positive
6102	API_NAME can be used.	Positive
6106	Here's a good example from Jetty's wiki page WEB_ADDRESS.	Positive
6144	Using consistent indentation and sensible whitespace can make your code much easier to read.	Positive
6184	Very good example of steady pooling readHere.	Positive
6238	Now we're getting to the good part.	Positive
6308	So far i've done this for Twitter and it works very well.	Positive
6328	I solved the earlier problem.	Positive
6359	Addendum: CODE_FRAGMENT is useful for managing lengthy background tasks while displaying interim progress.	Positive
6	But sadly this is not working.	Negative
78	So, everything builds fine, but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.	Negative
90	That is what is causing your null pointer exception.	Negative
139	All attempts I've made were, in a shortcut, unsuccessful.	Negative
162	Don't use.	Negative
187	However when I try to run FILE_NAME, it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.	Negative
200	Problem: without zooming, the added content doesn't get visible.	Negative
201	in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size, but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.	Negative
256	else your GUI will be Hanged.	Negative
342	I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast.	Negative
361	But the above code doesn't work outside the ``FILE_NAME JavaAgent`` FILE_NAME of the main Agent.	Negative
436	Please note there is a bug in FILE_NAME, L996 +997.	Negative
444	I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.	Negative
448	the problem is the following.	Negative
491	When I run my client, it throws the following exception.	Negative
521	i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.	Negative
526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral
44	According to docs.	Neutral
57	the way this projects i associated is.	Neutral
89	In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral
181	I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.	Neutral
183	resources/API _ NAME creation option: package required library into FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
191	While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system, most other applications can not.	Neutral
196	Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.	Neutral
204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive

15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral
39	Many thanks.	Neutral
40	Use this construct.	Neutral

98	I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity, but it returns NULL DataSource.	Neutral
105	and hear is the code to connect.	Neutral
112	Thanks for any help with this.	Neutral
119	Also, what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?	Neutral
121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
140	What I am trying to do.	Neutral
145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral
146	I did this like this.	Neutral
153	Thanks.	Neutral
156	You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
166	I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.	Neutral
179	I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.	Neutral

204	actually, it looks smth like this.	Neutral
209	So try.	Neutral
217	I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.	Neutral
223	That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.	Neutral
227	because this API depends on which server ( tomcat, jetty ) you are using.	Neutral
228	so it comes with the server.	Neutral
232	Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.	Neutral
238	Hope this helps.	Neutral
239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive

239	I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).	Neutral
240	I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.	Neutral
242	Any solutions out there?	Neutral
244	I am assuming that, you have a desktop program, which is running on the ftpserver itself.	Neutral
248	Lets see....	Neutral
259	You can get all notifications using ftplet.	Neutral
264	While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.	Neutral
266	There is a central interface to access this API.	Neutral
268	So a simple initialization would be.	Neutral
272	It should mean either of the following two.	Neutral
276	Or, assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say, A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.	Neutral
281	So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans, like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?	Neutral
293	But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?	Neutral
298	Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.	Neutral
304	The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name, and we only use the name of the site as a convention.	Neutral
331	I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.	Neutral
334	Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?	Neutral
348	Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.	Neutral
352	This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.	Neutral
355	I've attached a font (.	Neutral
357	This library is attached to a Java Agent.	Neutral
358	In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.	Neutral
369	Then, I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.	Neutral
371	in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).	Neutral
393	due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.	Neutral
394	But now, I have also integrated PowerMock in it.	Neutral
398	You have to use the PowerMockRule.	Neutral
402	and you should get the following test results.	Neutral
405	With this annotation, you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!	Neutral
406	I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.	Neutral
408	How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??	Neutral
412	First declare it like this.	Neutral
418	For example: if I have an excel sheet populated, I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?	Neutral
419	Thank you in advance.	Neutral
420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral

559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
6	But sadly this is not working.	Negative
78	So, everything builds fine, but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.	Negative
90	That is what is causing your null pointer exception.	Negative
139	All attempts I've made were, in a shortcut, unsuccessful.	Negative
162	Don't use.	Negative
187	However when I try to run FILE_NAME, it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.	Negative
200	Problem: without zooming, the added content doesn't get visible.	Negative
201	in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size, but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.	Negative
256	else your GUI will be Hanged.	Negative
342	I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast.	Negative
361	But the above code doesn't work outside the ``FILE_NAME JavaAgent`` FILE_NAME of the main Agent.	Negative
436	Please note there is a bug in FILE_NAME, L996 +997.	Negative
444	I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.	Negative
448	the problem is the following.	Negative
491	When I run my client, it throws the following exception.	Negative
521	i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.	Negative
526	I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.	Negative
4	Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
5	and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.	Neutral
9	Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.	Neutral
11	You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.	Neutral
15	Now you can use.	Neutral
20	About setting default production profile already posted @andih.	Neutral
25	So I do the following.	Neutral

121	EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.	Neutral
122	Await( ) as per the docs says.	Neutral
131	With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.	Neutral
134	Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.	Neutral
136	CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral

145	Well I thought I am authorized, once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.	Neutral

420	Yes, you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.	Neutral
425	In order to improve performance, data which relates to output information ( eg.	Neutral
435	You'll have to write some utility to do this, however it is possible to do in JXL.	Neutral
445	Any help would be appreciated.	Neutral
446	Here are my classes.	Neutral
457	You use the simple array with the fix size 5.	Neutral
458	It means, that if you add more than 5 hobbies, it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
460	The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default, which means, that if you set less than 5 hobbies, you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
464	So my question now is.	Neutral
467	Any help here?	Neutral
473	You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.	Neutral
490	And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.	Neutral
493	As the error says,.	Neutral
494	So you must change the signature of your method to.	Neutral
497	You can not return any thing.	Neutral
506	It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....	Neutral
523	Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.	Neutral
527	I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array, but only 2 are failing, my array is returning: student1, student2, null, null.	Neutral
528	My current result when I do a test run in main is.	Neutral
529	You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ), but not necessarily filling all the slots.	Neutral
551	By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.	Neutral
554	this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).	Neutral
555	Have a look at.	Neutral
559	Say the fruits are, apples, oranges, mangoes,... etc., If the user selects apples, I call apples ( ), if he selects mangoes, I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called, I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.	Neutral
560	How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?	Neutral
561	NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.	Neutral
563	Use CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
577	Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.	Neutral
581	Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).	Neutral
582	Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder, ran on a Unix machine.	Neutral
588	I apologize if I missed anything obvious.	Neutral
589	Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.	Neutral
590	To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment, you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.	Neutral
591	Using the code above, it should look like this.	Neutral
595	Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.	Neutral
596	Check the return of.	Neutral
600	You could also use.	Neutral
601	to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.	Neutral
607	If I got this right.	Neutral
620	Depending on what you need to accomplish, there might be better / other ways to achieve that.	Neutral
623	Based on the stacktrace, your output directory is not empty.	Neutral
634	A FILE_NAME name should be used.	Neutral
641	In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.	Neutral
642	If I'm now running my programm with the following command.	Neutral
644	Why does it treat this as my output directory?	Neutral
645	I specified another directory as the output directory.	Neutral
69	Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.	Positive
137	I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.	Positive
182	When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.	Positive
269	Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.	Positive
340	Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.	Positive
423	It even works on Android.	Positive
424	CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).	Positive
469	And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.	Positive
519	Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.	Positive
594	It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.	Positive
654	Besides increasing your heap, most of the time, it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.	Positive
664	You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.	Positive
724	APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.	Positive
